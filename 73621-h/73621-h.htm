<h2 class="nobreak p2b">THE FRENCH SHORT-STORY</h2>
</div>


<p>In zest, movement, and airy charm, in glittering
style, precise characterization, and compressed
vividness, the French short-story is unsurpassed.
German writers have excelled in the fantastic
and legendary tale; Russians, in both mysticism
and in unrestrained naturalism; British, in those
subtle moral distinctions which reveal character
under crucial stress; Americans, more or less in
all these phases; but no nation has ever developed
a school of story-tellers who say so much in so
few words, and, withal, say it so artistically and
pungently as do the French.</p>

<p>There is a real distinction between a short-story
in French and a French short-story. The
latter implies a national genre, and indeed this
implication is sustained by an examination of
French shorter fiction.</p>

<p>We are justified in asserting the existence of a
national type of short-story in France, or in any
other land, when its special literary product
reflects in theme the typical spirit of the nation,
when its attitude toward life is characteristic,
when its literary style is decidedly marked by
national idioms, and when local color—by which
I mean an individual flavor of characters and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
locality—is marked enough to be recognized as
a literary trait. Tested by each of these four
standards—which I have ventured to set up
rather arbitrarily—the short-story in France is
the French short-story.</p>

<p>A single example may serve to illustrate the
application of these tests. Here, let us imagine,
are two short-stories written in French and by
Frenchmen. The one deals with a baseball game,
played in Hawaii. Its argot is that of the “diamond,”
and its attitude is that of the frenzied
“fan.” The tone and the Hawaiian background
will furnish local-color enough. The second
story has for its theme a tragic family schism
caused by the struggle over clericalism in France.
The attitude of the characters is typical of the
contesting parties, the language is richly idiomatic,
and the local-color convincing. Of course
it would require no wisdom to determine which
was the French short-story and which merely
the short-story in French.</p>

<p>Now, when the great mass of short-stories
written in France meet two or more of these tests,
we have a national type of short-story, and I
believe that the ten stories grouped in these two
little books sufficiently illustrate the French
national spirit to warrant our accepting them as
types.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>At first thought it might appear that the same
might be asserted of any nation where short-stories
are produced—Italy, for example. But
the facts would not bear out any such statement.
True, some Italian writers are sufficiently imbued
with their language and nationality, and yet
sufficiently modern, to produce little fictions
which are typically Italian and typically short-stories,
but they are too few to constitute a school.
The novel, poetry and the drama have thus far
claimed the best efforts of Italian literary folk.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In these pages the word short-story is used
somewhat broadly, yet with an eye to the technical
distinctions between it and similar forms of
short narrative.</p>

<p>Since the earliest story-writing of which we
have record in the tales of the Egyptian papyri
(4000 B. C.?), there have been short fictional
narratives in many lands, some of which meet
almost every requirement of the short-story form
as we now know it. But that every such approach
to the short-story was sporadic rather than from
intention to conform to a recognized standard is
certain because in each case there was shown no
progress toward a repetition of the form, but,
instead, a reversion to the types common to all
short fiction—the straightforward, unplotted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
chain of incidents which we call the <em>tale</em>; the
light delineation of some mood, character, or fixed
situation, likewise without real plot, which we
name the <em>sketch</em>; the condensed outline of what
might well be expanded into a long story, which
we term the <em>scenario</em>; and the brief recital of
some incident with a point, known as the <em>anecdote</em>.</p>

<p>With occasional accidental exceptions, as just
noted, all the Egyptian tales, Greek and Roman
stories, sacred narratives, mediæval tales,
legends, and wonder-stories, and modern short
fictions down to the first quarter of the nineteenth
century, were of these four types.</p>

<p>The short-story as a conscious genre was
developed in America and in France about the
same time, with the weight of opinion favoring
Poe as its “inventor.”</p>

<p>In 1830 Balzac began a brilliant series of novelettes,
almost short-stories, which lack only compression
and unity of impression to stamp him
and not Poe as the first consistent and conscious
producer of the new form. As it is, these remarkable
stories are so near to technical perfection
(as short-stories, for there can be little adverse
criticism upon them as fiction), that he must
share with two Americans the distinction of producing
little stories which must have helped Poe
materially to see the new form in clear constructive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
vision—I mean Irving and Hawthorne.
Prior to 1835—the date of “Berenice,” Poe’s
first technically perfect short-story—both Irving
and Hawthorne had produced short fictions
incomparably in advance of any consistently
frequent short narrative work theretofore.
Irving’s style was kin to Addison’s essay-stories
in the <em>Spectator</em>, and even in those altogether
admirable tale-short-stories, “Rip Van Winkle”
and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” the influence
of the essay form is quite evident. Hawthorne’s
stories were chiefly symbolical tales, up
to 1835,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or expanded anecdotes done to create a
single effect upon the mind. In this they rival
the singularly potent unity of Poe’s best work.
But shortly Hawthorne turned more and more
aside from the short-story to the long symbolical
romance, in which he stands without a peer in any
land.</p>

<p>Then arose in France—for other countries
require no further comment here—a series of
notable story-writers, of supreme distinction in
all that goes to make the short-story the most
popular literary type: compressed delineation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>of a single crucial situation, highly centralized
leading character, swift characterization, deft
handling of crisis, climax, and dénouement, and,
throughout, masterful work in local color.</p>

<p>The short-story nomenclature among the
French is not clearly translatable, for three
reasons—we have no precise English equivalents,
critics do not entirely agree upon what equivalents
are nearest to the French terms, and, best reason
of all, the French short-stories have this in common
with all others: their forms often overlap,
and so bear marks of touching more than one
type. And when I have said this I have said
nothing to their discredit; only the Procrustean
purist first builds a bed and then stretches or cuts
every story-guest to fit! I cannot say this in
voice loud enough: to set up a standard of what
is a true short-story is no more to decry those
short fictive narratives which do not meet the
form than it would be to brand the lyric as imperfect
because it does not fulfill the requirements
of the epic.</p>

<p>But, to be specific, the three terms which we
constantly meet in French fiction are <em>roman</em>,
<em>nouvelle</em>, and <em>conte</em>. The <em>roman</em> may be dismissed
as a general term standing largely for what we in
English variously denominate the (long) romance,
the novel, and the (long) tale. The <em>nouvelle</em> most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
nearly approaches our English short-story, but
it also stands for the novelette, or very short
novel, or even the expanded short-story. The
<em>conte</em> is really a generic word for a short fictional
narrative or any story that is short, like the tale,
the anecdote, and the fictional sketch, without
meaning specifically the short-story to whose
characteristics of compression, unity of impression,
and crisis, climax and dénouement of plot,
I have just referred.</p>

<p>So I repeat: in these studies the term short-story
must be given some latitude of interpretation.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The French short-story of the last eighty years
is not only typically Gallic but characteristic of
the period. Just as there are four tests of nationality
in fiction so there are four forces which contribute
to its periodicity: The influence of the
soil, the heritage of the preceding period, the
special characteristics of the period itself, and the
influence of surrounding nations. All these result
in what may be called the Spirit of the Period,
concerning which a word must be said presently.</p>

<p>The primacy of the French as <em>conteurs</em> is doubtless
due quite as much to the rich and colorful
provincial life which surrounds the capital as to
their priority as tellers of short tales. It has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
said that Paris is France. Nothing could be less
true. Here is a nation which presents the unique
paradox of being at once and supremely homogeneous
and heterogeneous. The life of each
province is part of its soil, colored by the soil—or
by the ever-present sea. Yet France has a
spirit of nationality equalled by no other nation.
While what is now the German Empire was still
an unrelated number of minor peoples or an integral
part of some vaster state, France was a
unified or at least a closely federated kingdom.
While Britain was changing under its successive
tides of invasion, what was essentially France
was sending out its national culture world-wide—it
over-climbed the Pyrenees, it spread into the
Low Countries, in the west it conquered the
Swiss tongue, it permeated the Rhenish provinces,
it implanted Norman life in Britain. Thus grew
the French national spirit.</p>

<p>Yet the provinces held tenaciously to their own
picturesque types, spoke their more than a hundred
<em>patois</em>, wore their folk costumes, sang their
native songs, danced their own dances—unchanging
through the centuries. And nowhere more
than in the French short-story may we see depicted
the peculiar French provincial traits. The
folk of Champagne and Picardy are shrewd,
subtle, ardent, and born <em>conteurs</em>—witness the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
stories of Juliette Lamber. Those of Berry are
stolid and solid, as pictured by Madame Nahant.
The Gascons are vivacious, daring, and cunning,
as set forth by Emil Pouvillon. The people of
Languedoc are simple, strong and violent, as
described by Georges Baume. The happy, excitable
sun-children of Provence, reveling among
their olive groves and vineyards, have been portrayed
by Alphonse Daudet; the picturesque
Provençal sailors and fisherfolk live again in the
stories of Auguste Marin; while Paul Arène has
done loving service not only for Provence but for
Maine as well. Maupassant has given us notable
portraits of the Norman—bold, tricky, ambitious,
economical, and of superb physique as befits the
sons of sturdy men-at-arms. Loti’s stories are
redolent of the salty spume of rough, melancholy,
religious Brittany. And so, in the same recognition
of rich material, Theuriet paints Lorraine,
Erckmann and Chatrian the Rhine province of
Alsace, Fabre the Cévennes, Anatole le Braz the
Breton coast, Mérimée Corsica, Maupassant
Auverne, and Balzac Touraine. What a wonderful
color box has the French story-painter always
open to his brush! Truly the soil and the sea have
marked this period of the short-story as well as
the novel.</p>

<p>The inheritance of the preceding period—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
of the Revolution, the First Empire, and the First
Restoration—was rich in war pictures, dramatic
episodes of intrigue, and a never-so-remarkable
display of contrasts in human passion and changing
conditions. The French short-story is therefore
full of these national conditions.</p>

<p>The period itself, 1830-1912, witnessed kaleidoscopic
social and governmental changes—the
Second Restoration, the Bourgeois Monarchy,
the Second Republic, the Second Empire, the
Franco-Prussian War, the Commune, and the
Third Republic, to say nothing of numberless
minor attempts at change. All these filled the
story-teller’s pack with rich national materials.
Especially are the problems of socialism, militarism
and clericalism in evidence.</p>

<p>Finally, the influence of surrounding peoples
has been felt not only in the content but in the
form of the French short-story.</p>

<p>All these forces, and others less ponderable,
have fused into what I may term the nineteenth
century French spirit, as illustrated and measurably
interpreted by the French short-story.</p>

<p>Three sub-tones of this French symphony, to
use a trope, are emotional nature, passion for
military glory, and religious sentiment. Emotional
endowment the French, in common with
other Latin races, possess—a fact which calls for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
no comment. The military spirit, chastened by
the experiences of the Franco-Prussian War, has
been decreasingly in evidence during the last four
decades, yet indications are not wanting that the
fire burns none the less vitally because smothered
by practicalities. The war-theme constantly
recurs in the short-story, and “glory” is still dear
to every Frenchman. As for the third element,
religion, the evidence is more contradictory.
France has always felt a deep undercurrent of
religious feeling. Her public worship has perpetuated
this ideal in churches many and noble,
as well as in a pomp of ceremonial peculiarly
suited to an artistic Latin people. But I should
seek for the surest proof of the religious spirit not
so much in these signs as in the life of the provinces,
the influence of the church there, and their
constant manifestations of religious faith. The
clerical crisis was not confined to the great cities,
so that the last twenty years has shown marked
changes in public sentiment, but there are potent
signs of a reaction toward free religious life, for
France will be church-loving. The typical abbé
lives in her fiction as beautifully as does the
soldier.</p>

<p>And so I have ventured to name emotion, war,
and religion as three significant sub-tones of
French life. But there are five other phases of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
French spirit which show out in the short-story,
though they do not seem to me so fundamental.
Of these now a few words.</p>

<p>We find, first, volatile sentiment, as shown in
quick changes of attitude, sudden concentrations,
extremes of gayety and depression, lively speech,
and a general habit of regarding a tempest in a
teapot as a serious crisis, with now and then a
surprising way of smiling away a real tragedy.
There is much of the child-nature here, and therefore
the loving, the lovable, and the sweet.</p>

<p>Love of hearth is another French characteristic,
the mistresses and assignations, true and fictive,
to the contrary notwithstanding. The typical
homes of any nation are found less in its cities
than in its smaller centers; and so it is in France,
for the bulk of high-grade fiction is pretty certain
to be a safe index of public feeling.</p>

<p>A third characteristic is the unique attitude
of the French toward womanhood. The mother,
in France, is honored above belief; the wife
somewhat less so; the young girl knows nothing,
and is therefore merely amusing; the woman of
easy morals occupies a large place because she
must be reckoned with as a <em>recognized</em> factor.
The whole attitude of France toward its womanhood
is compounded of sentiment, lightness, and
cynicism. Less independent than the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
woman, less free than the English, less domestic
than the German, the French woman is more a
being to charm man than a companion for him.
And so runs the current of the short-story, side
by side with the sweep of life.</p>

<p>A fourth trait in the French short-story is a
minute, detached observation, tinged with cynicism—the
inevitable result of realism. It is for
this reason that so many French short-stories
seem unsympathetic. Scientific observation—really,
a German trait—is likely to be cold when
applied to tumults of the soul! And the writer
who as a moral vivisectionist relentlessly applies
the scalpel runs the risk of becoming blasé, not
to say cruel. He is more concerned with the truth
<em>of</em> facts than with extracting the truth <em>from</em>
facts.</p>

<p>A final characteristic is artistry. To do a short-story
with fineness, deftness, perfection of detail,
and beauty of finish; to cut an intaglio, so to say,
to paint a miniature, to inlay a jewel—that is the
Frenchman’s conception of the artistic in brief
fiction, and in that he is unsurpassed.</p>

<p>Here, then, are some qualities of the French
spirit as evidenced in the short-story of the period—qualities
fundamental and in the phase, but
patent, as it seems to me, in a large proportion of
the entire short-story product.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Viewing the subject generally, as one must in
attempting a survey of so varied a field as the last
eighty years in French fiction, there are several
periods fairly well-defined in the movement of the
short-story. As a differentiated type the short-story
appeared at a time when classical ideals of
form had broken down and moral ideals also had
quite fallen. For three decades, precise, logical
prose had been as cheerfully scouted as were old-fashioned
swaddling-clothes of personal virtue.
For a period equally long, “Freedom” had been
the sweet word every one uttered with unction.
Rousseau had laid his blade to the root of the existing
order; Chateaubriand had broken loose
from the fetters of old literary forms; Madame de
Staël had coined the word “romanticism” with
a new image and a superscription enchanting to
the mind agitated by the sudden opening of the
unknown; the success of French arms abroad had
let in a flood of new ideas—the reign of romance
was undisputed. Color, movement, dreams,
enthusiasm—all these prose began to borrow from
poetry. Charles Emmaniel Nodier—a classicist
in form, but a romanticist in spirit—began his
florid tales, while Théophile Gautier and Alfred
de Musset applied their poetic skill to the telling
of prose stories.</p>

<p>But the romantic movement began to wane in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
the early forties, not, however, before reaching a
brilliant high-tide in the work of the elder Dumas.
Even Gautier would sometimes scoff in his supremely
clever style at the extravagances of the
period. But the chief force in this breakdown of
the romantic school was Honoré de Balzac, whose
brilliant short-story work, chiefly done from 1830
to 1832, laid the foundations of a new school of
shorter fiction in France, as the de Goncourts and
Stendhal had already done for longer fiction—for
Balzac was less an originator than a developer of
the psychological novel. However, in fiction long
and short, his moderate realism stands to-day as
the most important example of his school.
Prosper Mérimée became a realist only after
having begun as a romanticist; Alphonse Daudet
never fully came under the sway of realistic
principles; and Ludovic Halévy generally chose a
romantic theme even when treating it realistically,
so that we must turn to Balzac as the representative
of his class.</p>

<p>In Gustave Flaubert, a stylist of the most
finished order, but latterly a severe classicist, we
find an example of the slight classical reaction
which followed the reign of realism. A similar
romantic reaction is seen in the short tales of the
collaborators, Émile Erckmann and Alexandre
Chatrain, as well as of François Coppée. Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
the joint influence of the German Hoffmann and
the American Poe is plainly evident.</p>

<p>But these reactionary movements were neither
powerful nor for long. The disillusionment and
cynicism of French life was bound to find expression
in its fiction, and the more sincere and fearless
the writer the more direct would be his methods.
Naturalism became the final expression of realism,
for naturalism is realism plus pessimism. Naturalism
proposes not only to see things as they are
and report things as they are seen, but it is a
pessimist who sees and reports. Result—gloom,
mire, and jagged stories, unkissed by a single star
of hope! Émile Zola is the chief-priest, and
Eugene Sue the industrious acolyte at the altar
of this despairing cult.</p>

<p>No people, however, could long enjoy an orgy
of depression, and signs of moderation soon
appeared. Guy de Maupassant, with all his
abnormality, and Paul Bourget with all his pessimism,
now and then touched the joyous side,
and by and by a braver, more wholesome tone
sounded in the French short-story—a tone of
eclecticism, both of method and of philosophy.
Surrounded by a social order emancipated from
many past ills and having the promise of greater
equity, quieted by the more or less permanent
settlement of at least two of its most vexed questions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
the France of to-day is encouraging a group
of brilliant writers—Pierre Loti, Anatole France,
Gustave Droz, Jules Lemaître, Jules Claretie,
Renè Bazin, Jean Richepin, Marcel Prévost, and
Paul Margueritte—who, though mostly no longer
young, represent a youthful France in that they
are emancipated from school and type and write
as the story makes its call to their own natures.
Sometimes one method, sometimes another, rises
to dominance, but <em>the choice of the most available</em>
is after all the current practice.</p>

<p>Of the future no man may tell, but backed by
the rich traditions of literary France, the air of
artistry all about, the growth of a more unselfish
socialized life, and the promise of stable national
conditions, we may well look for the most satisfying
results in the French short-story of tomorrow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2b">FRANÇOIS COPPÉE AND HIS WORK</h2>
</div>


<p>There never has been a satisfactory definition
of poetry, though all ambitious literary
appraisers, from Aristotle down to Bernard Shaw,
have essayed the task. But if to be able to institute
apt and beautiful comparisons; to phrase in
musical language thoughts of power, beauty, and
feeling; to discern the ideal clothed in the real;
to interpret the inner meanings of life—if this
ability marks the poetic gift, then François
Edouard Joachim Coppée was a poet—a poet in
prose as well as in verse.</p>

<p>Very early in life the young Parisian—he was
born in Paris, January 12, 1842—began to write
verses which showed marks of distinction, and he
was only twenty-four when <em>Le Reliquaire</em>, his
first poetic volume, appeared. Two years later,
<em>Poèmes Modernes</em> and <em>La Grève des Forgerons</em> were
issued, establishing his place among modern poets
of his land. And when, in 1869, at the age of
twenty-seven, he produced <em>Le Passant</em>, a group
of exquisite comedies in verse, he became a
celebrity.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that a literary dweller in the
French capital, reared among the traditions of a
stage whose productions are classic, and a poet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
who by both nature and environment breathed
in the air of art, should turn to the drama after
having won to the forefront in lyric and narrative
expression. Successively he produced <em>Deux
Douleurs</em>, <em>Fais ce que dois</em>, <em>Les Bijoux de la
Délivrance</em>, <em>Madame de Maintenon</em>, and <em>Le Luthier
de Crémorne</em>—the last-named an especially pleasing
drama, full of that human feeling which marks
Coppée in all his writings. Four volumes contain
his dramatic work, all of it good, much of it
brilliant.</p>

<p>As a novelist, Coppée left no mark upon his
times—he was so easily surpassed in this field by
his contemporaries. But as a writer of little prose
fictions, he stands well forward among that brilliant
group which includes those immortals of the
short-story—Maupassant, Daudet, Mérimée,
Balzac, Gautier, Loti, Halévy, Theuriet, and
France.</p>

<p>From the work of all these masters, Coppée’s
is well distinguished. The Norman Maupassant
drew his lines with a sharper pencil, and by that
same token an infinitely harder one. Daudet,
child of Provence though he was, dipped his stylus
more often in the acid of satire. Balzac chose his
“cases” from classes high and low, but rarely
failed to uncover with his sharp scalpel some
malignant social growth. Gautier was rougher,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
coarser, and less sympathetic, though at times
we may discern in him the sudden swelling tear
and tremulous lip which now and again reveal the
tenderness latent in brusk men. Halévy was
more idyllic and pastoral. Mérimée of all this
wonderful company—to whose society other
notables also come with insistent and well-sustained
claims for admission—was the nearest
to Coppée in the type of his work. Both knew
intimately and with tender feeling the life of
lowly folk—Coppée finding ever in his Paris the
themes, the scenes, the types for his stories, while
Mérimée’s pen was never so magic as when the
romantic Corsican airs breathed about his brow.
Both these master craftsmen produced a prose
infused with the imagery, grace, and charm of
poesy; both were masters of a style nervous,
firm, condensed, and vivid.</p>

<p>In 1878, after having been for some years employed
in the Senate Library, Coppée was appointed
Guardian of the Archives of the Comédie
Française. It was then that he began to produce
that remarkable series of some fifty short fictions
by which he is best known to us. One year after
the publication of his first volume of stories,
<em>Contes en Prose</em> (1882), he was distinguished by
election to the Academy, and in 1885 he was made
an officer of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>His other collections of stories are <em>Vingt Contes
Nouveaux</em> (1883), <em>Contes et Recits en Prose</em> (1885),
<em>Contes Rapides</em> (1888), <em>Contes Tout Simples</em> (1894),
and <em>Contes pour les Jours de Fête</em> (1903).</p>

<p>In considering Coppée’s fictional work, it seems
worth while to point out its varied types, and at
the same time note the meaning of several short
fictional forms which will be referred to frequently
in this volume and in succeeding volumes of the
series.</p>

<p>His favorite type seems to have been the tale—which
is not the plotted short-story, nor yet the
sketch, but rather a straightforward narration
with little or no plot, and usually depending for
its interest upon a longer or shorter chain of
incidents. The French word <em>conte</em> sufficiently
describes the tale, because <em>conte</em> means really
just <em>story</em>, and thus the generic term includes all
the shorter fictional forms. To most English
readers, the term short-story means merely a
story that is short, but modern usage limits the
word—the compound word, to be precise—to a
somewhat specialized type.</p>

<p>The typical short-story eludes precise definition,
because it is an elastic, living thing—often
the more interesting for its very disregard of an
exact technical form. Certain things, however,
the real short-story does possess: a single central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
dominant incident, a single preëminent character
or pair of characters, a complication (not necessarily
at all involved) the resolution or untying
or dénouement of that complication, and a treatment
so compressed and unified as to produce a
singleness of impression. Here, naturally, is
much latitude, but above all the short-story must
focus a white light upon one spot, upon a crucial
instance, to use Mrs. Wharton’s admirable expression,
and must not diffuse that light over a
whole life, a series of loosely related happenings,
or a general condition of affairs.</p>

<p>But the fictional sketch presents nothing of the
organization seen in the typical short-story. It is
a fragment, a detached though perhaps a complete
impression, a bit of character caught in passing,
a rapidly outlined picture, but not depending
upon a complication and its unfolding for its
interest.</p>

<p>Like the sketch, the tale is more easily defined
than the short-story. Whether long or short, the
tale—as I have just pointed out—is always the
simple narration of an incident, or a succession of
incidents, without regard to plot-complication
and its consequent dénouement. The story of a
thrilling lion-hunt, the recovery of a lost child, the
adventures of a hero under strange skies, or the
patient loyalty of an old servitor, might any one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
them be its theme—that and nothing more.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>How much a fictional masterpiece suffers in
translation none knows so well as he who enjoys
its beauties in the original. How much more then
must it lose when one attempts to rehearse its
story in brief synopsis. Yet we may come to some
understanding of Coppée’s typical variety by
such an examination of three of his short pieces,
besides “The Substitute,” which is given in full
in translation.</p>

<p>“At Table” is one of the author’s characteristic
sketches. It is about twenty-five hundred words
long. Fourteen are at table, the guests of
“<em>madame la comtesse</em>”—“four young women in
full toilette, and ten men belonging to the aristocracy
of blood or of merit.” With that pictorial
gift which is the literary sketch-artist’s first possession,
we are shown the whole scene—“jewels,
decorations of honor or of nobility, the atmosphere
of good living in the high hall,” the glittering
table, the noiseless service, the expanding
social spirit as the collation advances, the “snapping
of bright words,” and everything that made
the dinner “charming as well as sumptuous.”</p>

<p>“Now, at that same table, at the lower end,
in the most modest place, a man still young ...
a man of reverie and imagination ... sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
silent.” “He was plunged in a bath of optimism;
it seemed good to him that there should be, sometimes
and somewhere in the weary world, beings
almost happy.” “But when the Dreamer had
before him on his plate a portion of the monstrous
turbot, the light odor of the sea evoked in his
mind a picture of the Breton fisher folk, by grace
of whose dangers this delectation came to the
feasters.”</p>

<p>Thus his fancy wanders on, vividly rebuilding
the varied scenes peopled by those whose labors,
painful often and ill-requited, made possible the
revelry that night. The contrast stands out,
white against black, and leads at last to this mixed
conclusion: Softly and stubbornly he repeats to
himself as he looks once again at the guests as,
replete, they arise from table:</p>

<p>“Yes; they are within their rights. But do
they know, do they comprehend, that their luxury
is made from many miseries? Do they think of it
sometimes? Do they think of it as often as they
should? Do they think of it?”</p>

<p>Rarely does Coppée approach so closely to
making a preachment; but we need only to follow
his gentle reflections—so far removed from
haranguing, from bitterness—to feel the utter
sincerity of this heart that so passionately loved
“the people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“Two Clowns” is a sketch of a different type—less
aggressively moral, its conclusion more subtly
enforced, and possessing more of the narrative
quality of the tale. It is a dual sketch—a sketch
of contrasts.</p>

<p>We are standing before the tent of some strolling
acrobats. To lure the bystanders to the performance
a clown receives the rain of pretended
buffets from the hands of the ring-master—quite
in the manner we all know. Now an aged crone
among the onlookers is seen to be weeping. On
being questioned she wails out the story that she
has recognized in this wretched clown her only
son. Having robbed his master, he had been sent
away to sea, the father had died, and now after
having heard nothing of the scapegrace for years
she discovers in the buffeted clown her only child.
But suddenly the old woman realizes that she is
telling the intimate sorrows of her heart to the
gaping crowd, and with gesture abrupt and
imperious she pushes aside her listeners and disappears
in the night.</p>

<p>The second scene is in the Chamber of Deputies,
at a sensational sitting. An orator mounts the
tribune to denounce some proposed spoliation of
the people. With all the arts of the demagogue—wonderfully
delineated—he begins his string of
ready-made phrases. He postures, he mouths,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
he prophesies, he looses the dogs of war, “he even
risks a bit of poetry, flourishes old metaphors
which were worn-out in the time of Cicero,” and
amidst mingled bravos and grumbles “soars like
a goose,” and ends.</p>

<p>As we leave the Chamber we see an elderly
woman of the <em>bourgeoisie</em>. It is the mother of the
political mountebank—she is radiant and content.</p>

<p>“The Sabots of Little Wolff” is a typical tale,
done in the manner of a legend. Never was the
spirit of childhood—human and divine—more
exquisitely set forth than in this wonderfully
wrought story. How <em>can</em> it be told in other, or
fewer, words than those simple and eloquent sentences
of François Coppée!</p>

<p>“Once upon a time—it was so long ago that the
whole world has forgotten the date—in a city in
the north of Europe—whose name is so difficult
to pronounce that no one remembers it—once
upon a time there was a little boy of seven, named
Wolff. He was an orphan in charge of an old aunt
who was hard and avaricious, who embraced him
only on New Year’s Day, and who breathed a sigh
of regret every time she gave him a porringer of
soup.</p>

<p>“But the poor little fellow was naturally so
good that he loved the old woman all the same,
though she frightened him greatly, and he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
never without trembling see the huge wart, ornamented
with four gray hairs, which she had on the
end of her nose.”</p>

<p>On Christmas eve the schoolmaster took all his
pupils to the midnight mass. The winter was
cold, so the lads came warmly wrapped and shod—all
except little Wolff, who shivered in thin
garments, and heavy wooden shoes, or sabots.
“His thoughtless comrades made a thousand
jests over his sad looks and his peasant’s dress,”
and boasted of the wonderful times in store for
them on Christmas Day. Little Wolff knew very
well that his miserly aunt would send him supperless
to bed, yet he innocently hoped that the
Christ-child would not forget him on the
morrow.</p>

<p>On the way out little Wolff noticed sitting in a
niche under the porch a sleeping child—not a
beggar child, for he was covered by a robe of
white linen. But notwithstanding the cold his
feet were bare—and near him lay the tools of a
carpenter’s apprentice. None of the well-clad
scholars heeded the child, “but little Wolff, coming
last out of church, stopped, full of compassion,
before the beautiful sleeping infant,” took off his
right shoe, and laid it beside the child, “so the
Christ-child could put something therein to comfort
him in his misery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>At home his aunt scolded him well for having
given away his shoe, and scornfully she placed the
other sabot in the chimney, predicting that he
would find in it next morning only a rod for a
whipping. And with a couple of slaps the wicked
woman drove the child to bed.</p>

<p>But on Christmas morning little Wolff beheld
in artless ecstasy both his little sabots overflowing
with countless good things, so that the whole
chimney was full of them. But the outcries on
the street outside told them that the other
children of the school had each gotten only a
rod!</p>

<p>Finally, in “The Substitute” we have the
typical short-story. Though the plot is simple,
it is well balanced and marches forward with
never a digression nor a false step. The characters
live, the setting is adequate, and the treatment is
without artificiality. The rise of Leturc from the
purlieus of Paris to the moral grandeur which
leads him to his final imprisonment is simple, unaffected
and natural. There is not a trace of the
theatric in the whole story, not a suggestion of
false sentiment, not anything that mars its
beauty, its symmetry, and its power.</p>

<p>In the midst of so much that is sordid and gross
in modern fiction, how refreshing it is to read the
pages of a master who could be truthful without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
wallowing, moral without sermonizing, humorous
without buffooning, and always disclose in his
stories the spirit of a sympathetic lover of mankind!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SUBSTITUTE</h2>
</div>

<p class="center big1">(<em>LE REMPLAÇANT</em>)</p>

<p class="center big2">By François Coppée</p>

<p class="center p2b"><em>Done into English by the Editor</em></p>


<p>He was scarcely ten years old when he was
first arrested as a vagabond.</p>

<p>Thus he spoke to the judges:</p>

<p>“I am called Jean François Leturc, and for six
months now I’ve been with the man who sings
between two lanterns on the Place de la Bastille,
while he scrapes on a string of catgut. I repeat
the chorus with him, and then I cry out, 'Get the
collection of new songs, ten centimes, two sous!’
He was always drunk and beat me; that’s why
the police found me the other night, in the tumble-down
buildings. Before that, I used to be with
the man who sells brushes. My mother was a
laundress; she called herself Adèle. At one time
a gentleman had given her an establishment, on
the ground-floor, at Montmartre. She was a good
worker and loved me well. She made money
because she had the clientele of the café waiters,
and those people use lots of linen. Sundays, she
would put me to bed early to go to the ball; but
week days, she sent me to the Brothers’ school,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
where I learned to read. Well, at last the <em>sergent-de-ville</em>
whose beat was up our street began always
stopping before her window to talk to her—a fine
fellow, with the Crimean medal. They got
married, and all went wrong. He didn’t take to
me, and set mamma against me. Every one
boxed my ears; and it was then that, to get away
from home, I spent whole days on the Place
Clichy, where I got to know the mountebanks.
My step-father lost his place, mamma her customers;
she went to the wash-house to support
her man. It was there she got consumption—from
the steam of the lye. She died at Lariboisière.
She was a good woman. Since that
time I’ve lived with the brush-seller and the
catgut-scraper. Are you going to put me in
prison?”</p>

<p>He talked this way openly, cynically, like a
man. He was a ragged little rascal, as tall as a
boot, with his forehead hidden under a strange
mop of yellow hair.</p>

<p>Nobody claimed him, so they sent him to the
Reform School.</p>

<p>Not very intelligent, lazy, above all maladroit
with his hands, he was able to learn there only a
poor trade—the reseating of chairs. Yet he was
obedient, of a nature passive and taciturn, and he
did not seem to have been too profoundly corrupted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
in that school of vice. But when, having
come to his seventeenth year, he was set free again
on the streets of Paris, he found there, for his misfortune,
his prison comrades, all dreadful rascals
exercising their low callings. Some were trainers
of dogs for catching rats in the sewers; some
shined shoes on ball nights in the Passage de
l’Opéra; some were amateur wrestlers, who let
themselves be thrown by the Hercules of the
side-shows; some fished from rafts out in the
river, in the full sunlight. He tried all these
things a little, and a few months after he had left
the house of correction he was arrested anew for a
petty theft: a pair of old shoes lifted from out an
open shop-window. Result: a year of prison at
Sainte-Pélagie, where he served as valet to the
political prisoners.</p>

<p>He lived, astonished, among this group of
prisoners, all very young and negligently clad,
who talked in loud voices and carried their heads
in such a solemn way. They used to meet in the
cell of the eldest of them, a fellow of some thirty
years, already locked up for a long time and apparently
settled at Sainte-Pélagie: a large cell it
was, papered with colored caricatures, and from
whose windows one could see all Paris—its roofs,
its clock-towers, and its domes, and, far off, the
distant line of the hills, blue and vague against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
sky. There were upon the walls several shelves
filled with books, and all the old apparatus of a
<em>salle d’armes</em>—broken masks, rusty foils, leather
jackets, and gloves that were losing their stuffing.
It was there that the “politicians” dined together,
adding to the inevitable “soup and beef” some
fruit, cheese, and half-pints of wine that Jean
François went out to buy in a can—tumultuous
repasts, interrupted by violent disputes, where
they sang in chorus at the dessert the <em>Carmangole</em>
and <em>Ça ira</em>.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> They took on, however, an air of
dignity on days when they made place for a newcomer,
who was at first gravely treated as “citizen,”
but who was the next day <em>tutoyed</em>,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and
called by his nickname. They used big words
there—Corporation, Solidarity, and phrases all
quite unintelligible to Jean François, such as this,
for example, which he once heard uttered imperiously
by a frightful little hunchback who
scribbled on paper all night long:</p>

<p>“It is settled. The cabinet is to be thus composed:
Raymond in the Department of Education,
Martial in the Interior, and I in Foreign
Affairs.”</p>

<p>Having served his time, he wandered again
about Paris, under the surveillance of the police,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>in the fashion of beetles that cruel children keep
flying at the end of a string. He had become one
of those fugitive and timid beings whom the law,
with a sort of coquetry, arrests and releases, turn
and turn about, a little like those platonic fishermen
who, so as not to empty the pond, throw
back into the water the fish just out of the net.
Without his suspecting that so much honor was
done to his wretched personality, he had a special
docket in the mysterious archives of <em>la rue de
Jérusalem</em>,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> his name and surnames were written
in a large back-hand on the gray paper of the
cover, and the notes and reports, carefully classified,
gave him these graded appellations: “the
man named Leturc,” “the prisoner Leturc,”
and at last “the convicted Leturc.”</p>

<p>He stayed two years out of prison, dining <em>à la
Californie</em>,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> sleeping in lodging-houses, and sometimes
in lime-kilns, and taking part with his
fellows in endless games of pitch-penny on the
boulevards near the city gates. He wore a greasy
cap on the back of his head, carpet slippers, and a
short white blouse. When he had five sous, he
had his hair curled. He danced at Constant’s at
Montparnasse; bought for two sous the jack-of-hearts
or the ace-of-spades, which were used as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>return checks, to resell them for four sous at the
door of Bobino; opened carriage-doors as occasion
offered; led about sorry nags at the horse-market.
Of all the bad luck—in the conscription he drew a
good number.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Who knows whether the atmosphere
of honor which is breathed in a regiment,
whether military discipline, might not have
saved him? Caught in a haul of the police-net
with the young vagabonds who used to rob
the drunkards asleep in the streets, he denied
very energetically having taken part in their
expeditions. It was perhaps true. But his
antecedents were accepted in lieu of proof, and he
was sent up for three years to Poissy. There he
had to make rough toys, had himself tattooed on
the chest, and learned thieves’ slang and the penal
code. A new liberation, a new plunge into the
Parisian sewer, but very short this time, for at the
end of hardly six weeks he was again compromised
in a theft by night, aggravated by violent entry,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
a doubtful case in which he played an obscure
rôle, half dupe and half fence.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> On the whole, his
complicity seemed evident, and he was condemned
to five years’ hard labor. His sorrow in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>this adventure was, chiefly, to be separated from
an old dog which he had picked up on a heap of
rubbish and cured of the mange. This beast loved
him.</p>

<p>Toulon, the ball on his ankle, the work in the
harbor, the blows from the staves, the wooden
shoes without straw,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the soup of black beans
dating from Trafalgar, no money for tobacco,
and the horrible sleep on the filthy camp-bed of
the galley slave, that is what he knew for five
torrid summers and five winters blown upon by
the <em>Mistral</em>.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> He came out from there stunned,
and was sent under surveillance to Vernon, where
he worked for some time on the river; then, an
incorrigible vagabond, he broke exile and returned
again to Paris.</p>

<p>He had his savings, fifty-six francs—that is to
say, time enough to reflect. During his long
absence, his old and horrible comrades had been
dispersed. He was well hidden, and slept in a
loft at an old woman’s, to whom he had represented
himself as a sailor weary of the sea,
having lost his papers in a recent shipwreck,
and who wished to essay another trade. His
tanned face, his calloused hands, and a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>nautical terms he let fall one time or another,
made this story sufficiently probable.</p>

<p>One day when he had risked a saunter along the
streets, and when the chance of his walk had
brought him to Montmartre, where he had been
born, an unexpected memory arrested him before
the door of the Brothers’ school in which he had
learned to read. Since it was very warm, the door
was open, and with a single glance the passing
incorrigible could recognize the peaceful school-room.
Nothing was changed: neither the bright
light shining in through the large windows, nor the
crucifix over the desk, nor the rows of seats furnished
with leaden inkstands, nor the table of
weights and measures, nor the map on which pins
stuck in still pointed out the operations of some
ancient war. Heedlessly and without reflecting,
Jean François read on the blackboard these words
of the Gospel, which a well-trained hand had
traced as an example of penmanship:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth,
more than over ninety and nine just persons which need
no repentance.</p>
</div>

<p>It was doubtless the hour for recreation, for the
Brother professor had left his chair, and, sitting
on the edge of a table, he seemed to be telling a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
story to all the <em>gamins</em> who surrounded him, attentive
and raising their eyes. What an innocent
and gay countenance was that of the beardless
young man, in long black robe, with white necktie,
with coarse, ugly shoes, and with badly cut brown
hair pushed up at the back. All those pallid faces
of children of the populace which were looking
at him seemed less childlike than his, above all
when, charmed with a candid, priestly pleasantry
he had made, he broke out with a good and frank
peal of laughter, which showed his teeth sound
and regular—laughter so contagious that all the
scholars broke out noisily in their turn. And it
was simple and sweet, this group in the joyous
sunlight that made their clear eyes and their
blonde hair shine.</p>

<p>Jean François looked at the scene some time in
silence, and, for the first time, in that savage
nature all instinct and appetite, there awoke a
mysterious and tender emotion. His heart, that
rude, hardened heart, which neither the cudgel of
the galley master nor the weight of the watchman’s
heavy whip falling on his shoulders was
able to stir, beat almost to bursting. Before this
spectacle, in which he saw again his childhood, his
eyes closed sadly, and, restraining a violent gesture,
a prey to the torture of regret, he walked
away with great strides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>The words written on the blackboard came
back to him.</p>

<p>“If it were not too late, after all?” he murmured.
“If I could once more, like the others,
eat my toasted bread honestly, sleep out my sleep
without nightmare? The police spy would be
very clever to recognize me now. My beard, that
I shaved off down there, has grown out now thick
and strong. One can borrow somewhere in this
big ant-heap, and work is not lacking. Whoever
does not go to pieces soon in the hell of the galleys
comes out agile and robust; and I have learned
how to climb the rope-ladders with loads on my
back. Building is going on all around here, and
the masons need helpers. Three francs a day,—I
have never earned so much. That they should
forget me, that is all I ask.”</p>

<p>He followed his courageous resolution, he was
faithful to it, and three months afterward he was
another man. The master for whom he labored
cited him as his best workman. After a long day
passed on the scaffolding, in the full sun, in the
dust, constantly bending and straightening his
back to take the stones from the hands of the man
below him and to pass them to the man above
him, he went to get his soup at the cheap eating-house,
tired out, his legs numb, his hands burning,
and his eyelashes stuck together by the plaster,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
but content with himself, and carrying his well-earned
money in the knot of his handkerchief.
He went out without fear, for his white mask
made him unrecognizable, and, then, he had
observed that the suspicious glance of the policeman
seldom falls on the real worker. He was
silent and sober. He slept the sound sleep of
honest fatigue. He was free.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At last—supreme recompense!—he had a
friend.</p>

<p>It was a mason’s helper like himself, named
Savinien, a little peasant from Limoges, red-cheeked,
who had come to Paris with his stick
over his shoulder and his bundle on the end of it,
who fled from the liquor-dealers and went to mass
on Sundays. Jean François loved him for his
piety, for his candor, for his honesty, for all that
he himself had lost, and so long ago. It was a
passion profound reserved, disclosing itself in the
care and forethought of a father. Savinien, himself
easily moved and self-loving, let things take
their course, satisfied only in that he had found a
comrade who shared his horror of the wine-shop.
The two friends lived together in a furnished
room, fairly clean, but their resources were very
limited; they had to take into their room a third
companion, an old man from Auvergne, sombre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
and rapacious, who found a way of economizing
out of his meagre wages enough to buy some land
in his own province.</p>

<p>Jean François and Savinien scarcely left each
other. On days of rest they took long walks in the
environs of Paris and dined in the open air in one
of those little country inns where there are plenty
of mushrooms in the sauces and innocent enigmas
on the bottoms of the plates. There Jean François
made his friend tell him all those things of
which those born in the cities are ignorant. He
learned the names of the trees, the flowers, the
plants; the seasons for the different harvests;
he listened avidly to the thousand details
of a farmer’s labors: the autumn’s sowing,
the winter’s work, the splendid <em>fêtes</em> of
harvest-home and vintage, and the flails beating
the ground, and the noise of the mills by
the borders of the streams, and the tired
horses led to the trough, and the morning hunting
in the mists, and, above all, the long evenings
around the fire of vine-branches, shortened by
tales of wonder. He discovered in himself a spring
of imagination hitherto unsuspected, finding a
singular delight in the mere recital of these things,
so gentle, calm, and monotonous.</p>

<p>One anxiety troubled him, however, that
Savinien should not come to know his past.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Sometimes there escaped him a shady word of
thieves’ slang, an ignoble gesture, vestiges of his
horrible former existence; and then he felt the
pain of a man whose old wounds reopen, more
especially as he thought he saw then in Savinien
the awakening of an unhealthy curiosity. When
the young man, already tempted by the pleasures
which Paris offers even to the poorest, questioned
him about the mysteries of the great city, Jean
François feigned ignorance and turned the conversation;
but he had now conceived a vague
inquietude for the future of his friend.</p>

<p>This was not without foundation, and Savinien
could not long remain the naïve rustic he had been
on his arrival in Paris. If the gross and noisy
pleasures of the wine-shop always were repugnant
to him, he was profoundly troubled by other
desires full of danger for the inexperience of his
twenty years. When the spring came, he began
to seek solitude, and at first he wandered before
the gayly lighted entrances to the dancing-halls,
through which he saw the girls going in couples,
without bonnets—and with their arms around
each other’s waists, whispering low. Then, one
evening, when the lilacs shed their perfume, and
when the appeal of the quadrille was more entrancing,
he crossed the threshold, and after that
Jean François saw him change little by little in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
manners and in visage. Savinien became more
frivolous, more extravagant; often he borrowed
from his friend his miserable savings, which he
forgot to repay. Jean François, feeling himself
abandoned, was both indulgent and jealous; he
suffered and kept silent. He did not think he had
the right to reproach; but his penetrating friendship
had cruel and insurmountable presentiments.</p>

<p>One evening when he was climbing the stairs
of his lodging, absorbed in his preoccupations,
he heard in the room he was about to enter a
dialogue of irritated voices, and he recognized one
as that of the old man from Auvergne, who lodged
with him and Savinien. An old habit of suspicion
made him pause on the landing, and he listened
to learn the cause of the trouble.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the man from Auvergne angrily,
“I am sure that some one has broken open my
trunk and stolen the three louis which I had
hidden in a little box; and the man who has done
this thing can only be one of the two companions
who sleep here, unless it is Maria, the servant.
This concerns you as much as me, since you are
the master of the house, and I will drag you before
the judge if you do not let me at once open up
the valises of the two masons. My poor hoard!
It was in its place only yesterday; and I will tell
you what it was, so that, if we find it, no one can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
accuse me of lying. Oh, I know them, my three
beautiful gold pieces, and I can see them as
plainly as I see you. One was a little more worn
than the others, of a slightly greenish gold, and
that had the portrait of the great Emperor;
another had that of a fat old fellow with a queue
and epaulets; and the third had a Philippe with
side-whiskers. I had marked it with my teeth.
No one can trick me, not me. Do you know that
I needed only two others like those to pay for my
vineyard? Come on, let us look through the
things of these comrades, or I will call the police.
Make haste!”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the voice of the householder;
“we’ll search with Maria. So much the worse if
you find nothing, and if the masons get angry.
It is you who have forced me to it.”</p>

<p>Jean François felt his heart fill with fear. He
recalled the poverty and the petty borrowings of
Savinien, the sombre manner he had borne the
last few days. Yet he could not believe in any
theft. He heard the panting of the man from
Auvergne in the ardor of his search, and he
clenched his fists against his breast as if to repress
the beatings of his heart.</p>

<p>“There they are!” suddenly screamed the
victorious miser. “There they are, my louis, my
dear treasure! And in the Sunday waistcoat of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
that little hypocrite from Limoges. Look, landlord!
they are just as I told you. There’s the
Napoleon, and the man with the queue, and the
Philippe I had dented with my teeth. Look at
the mark. Ah, the little rascal with his saintly
look! I should more likely have suspected the
other. Ah, the villain! He will have to go to the
galleys!”</p>

<p>At this moment Jean François heard the well-known
step of Savinien, who was slowly mounting
the stairs.</p>

<p>“He is going to his betrayal,” thought he.
“Three flights. I have time!”</p>

<p>And, pushing open the door, he entered, pale
as death, into the room where he saw the landlord
and the stupefied servant in a corner, and the
man from Auvergne on his knees amid the disordered
clothes, lovingly kissing his gold
pieces.</p>

<p>“Enough of this,” he said in a thick voice.
“It is I who have taken the money and who have
put it in my comrade’s trunk. But that is too
disgusting. I am a thief and not a Judas. Go
hunt for the police. I’ll not try to save myself.
Only, I must say a word in private to Savinien,
who is here.”</p>

<p>The little man from Limoges had, in fact, just
arrived, and, seeing his crime discovered, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
believing himself lost, he stood still, his eyes
fixed, his arms drooping.</p>

<p>Jean François seized him violently about the
neck as though to embrace him; he pressed his
mouth to Savinien’s ear and said to him in a
voice low and supplicating:</p>

<p>“Be quiet!”</p>

<p>Then, turning to the others:</p>

<p>“Leave me alone with him. I shall not go
away, I tell you. Shut us up, if you wish, but
leave us alone.”</p>

<p>And, with a gesture of command, he showed
them the door. They went out.</p>

<p>Savinien, broken with anguish, had seated
himself on a bed, and dropped his eyes without
comprehending.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Jean François, who approached
to take his hands. “I understand you have stolen
three gold pieces to buy some trifle for a girl.
That would have cost six months of prison for
you. But one does not get out of that except to
go back again, and you would have become a
pillar of the police tribunals and the courts of
assizes. I know all about them. I have done
seven years in the Reform School, one year at
Sainte-Pélagie, three years at Poissy, and five years
at Toulon. Now, have no fear. All is arranged.
I have taken this affair on my shoulders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“Unhappy fellow!” cried Savinien; but hope
was already coming back to his cowardly heart.</p>

<p>“When the elder brother is serving under the
colors, the younger does not go,” Jean François
went on. “I’m your substitute, that’s all. You
love me a little, do you not? I am paid. Do not
be a baby. Do not refuse. They would have
caught me one of these days, for I have broken
my exile. And then, you see, that life out there
will be less hard for me than for you; I know it,
and shall not complain if I do not render you this
service in vain and if you swear to me that you
will not do it again. Savinien, I have loved you
well, and your friendship has made me very
happy, for it is thanks to my knowing you that
I have kept honest and straight, as I might always
have been, perhaps, if I had had, like you, a father
to put a tool in my hands, a mother to teach me
my prayers. My only regret was that I was
useless to you and that I was deceiving you
about my past. To-day I lay aside the mask
in saving you. It is all right. Come, good-by!
Do not weep; and embrace me, for already I
hear the big boots on the stairs. They are
returning with the police; and we must not
seem to know each other so well before these
fellows.”</p>

<p>He pressed Savinien hurriedly to his breast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and then he pushed him away as the door opened
wide.</p>

<p>It was the landlord and the man from
Auvergne, who were bringing the police. Jean
François started forward to the landing and held
out his hands for the handcuffs and said, laughing:</p>

<p>“Forward, bad lot!”</p>

<p>To-day he is at Cayenne, condemned for life,
as an incorrigible.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2b">GUY DE MAUPASSANT, REALIST</h2>
</div>


<p>The inflexible realist in fiction can be faithful
only to what he sees; and what he sees is
inevitably colored by the lens of his real self. For
the literary observer of life there is no way of
falsifying the reports which his senses, physical
and moral, make to his own brain. If he wishes,
he may make alterations in transcribing for his
readers, but in so doing he confesses to himself a
departure from truth as he sees it.</p>

<p>Pure realism, then, demands of its apostle both
a faithful observation of life and a faithful statement
of what he sees. True, the realist uses his
artist’s privilege of selecting those facts of life
which seem best suited to picturing his characters
in their natures, their persons, and their careers,
for he knows that many irrelevant, confusing,
and contradictory things happen in the everyday
lives of everyday men. So in point of practice
his realism is not so uncompromising as his
theories sound when baldly stated.</p>

<p>How near any great artist’s transcriptions
of life approach to absolute truth will always be
a question, both because we none of us know what
is final truth, and because realists, each seeing life
through his own nature, will disagree among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
themselves just as widely as their temperaments,
their predispositions, and their experiences vary.
Thus we are left to the common sense for our
standards, and to this common sense we may with
some confidence appeal for a judgment.</p>

<p>Guy de Maupassant was a realist. “The writer’s
eye,” he says in <em>Sur l’Eau</em>, “is like a suction-pump,
absorbing everything; like a pickpocket’s
hand, always at work. Nothing escapes him. He
is constantly collecting material; gathering up
glances, gestures, intentions, everything that goes
on in his presence—the slightest look, the least
act, the merest trifle.”</p>

<p>But Maupassant was more than a realist—he
was an artist, a realistic artist, frank and wise
enough to conform his theories to his own efficient
literary practice. He saw as a realist, selected as
an artist, and then was uncompromising in his
literary presentation.</p>

<p>Here at the outstart another word is needed:
Maupassant was also a literalist, and this native
trait served to render his realism colder and more
unsympathetic. By this I mean that to him two
and three always summed up five—his temperament
would not allow for the unseen, imponderable
force of spiritual things; and even when he
mentions the spiritual, it is with a sort of tolerant
unbelief which scorns to deny the superstitious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
solace of women, weaklings, and zealots. It was
this pervading quality in both character and
method which has caused his critics to class him
is a disciple of naturalism in fiction. However,
Maupassant’s pessimism was not so great that he
could not dwell upon scenes of joy; but a preacher
of hope he never was, nor could have been.</p>

<p>Maupassant led so individual a life, was so
unnormal in his tastes, and ended his career so
unusually, that common sense decides at once
the validity of this one contention: his realism
was marvellously true in details, but less trustworthy
in its general results. His pictures of
incidents were miracles of accuracy; his philosophy
of life was incomplete, morbid, and unnatural.</p>

<p>Think how unnormal must be a spirit who
could write, in the work just quoted: “I feel
vibrating through me something akin to every
form of animal life; I thrill with all the instincts
and confused desires of the lower creatures.
Like them I love the earth, not men, as you do.
I love it without admiring it, without poetizing
or exalting it; I love, with a profound and bestial
love, at once contemptible and sacred, all that
lives, all that thinks, all that we see about us,—days,
nights, rivers, seas, and forests, the dawn,
the rosy flesh and beaming eye of woman; for all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
these things, while they leave my mind calm,
trouble my eyes and my heart.”</p>

<p>But this author’s life may not be read in his
works, for, unlike his contemporary, Alphonse
Daudet, Maupassant’s writings are singularly
barren of personal detail. True to his naturalistic
school, and growing out of his method as well as
by reason of his individualistic philosophy, he
avoided all attempt at interpreting life and character
by the lights and leadings of his own personality.
And yet I have already intimated that
he was biased—as similarly we all are biased—by
his own nature; but it was not an artistic
prejudice; rather was it the temperamental bias
of a cynical eye trained to view the minute rather
than the large, the sordid rather than the ideal,
the pessimistic rather than the hopeful, the
physical rather than the spiritual—for this was
the sort of life he lived, first and last.</p>

<p>Persistently refusing to give to the public any
record of his life, he dwelt, as it were, behind
closed doors. No soul, he held, could enter into
the life of another soul, so he had no real intimates,
and those who called him friend and knew
the frank charm of his manner discussed with
him mainly impersonal themes. Thus in spite of
importunities he gave no encouragement to that
impertinent curiosity which avidly seizes upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the details of an author’s private life and flaunts
it to a gaping public. We, then, are concerned
with Maupassant’s temperament and personal
career only in so far as they color his work.</p>

<p>Born in Normandy in 1850, he passed his youth
in that charming section where he has laid the
scenes of many of his provincial narratives. The
picturesque Norman characters, the narrow-browed
country life, the colorful phases of town,
market, and church, appear with intaglio clearness
in a thousand wonderfully-wrought settings.
The sordid and ungracious bourgeoisie with
whom he came most in contact predominate in
these stories, just as his strenuous days as an oarsman
live again in his aquatic tales, and his life as
a minor clerk in the government and his experiences
as a soldier during the Franco-Prussian
War are used for material in other stories. It was
his later life in the Capital that gave him his
knowledge of society life, and of the underworld
peopled by courtesan and roué.</p>

<p>The gifted Flaubert, as everyone knows, left
a profound impress upon his young nephew,
Maupassant, who served under him a literary
apprenticeship at once rigid and productive. It
was Flaubert who taught the man of thirty to
seek for the one inevitably fitting word, made
him tear up early poems, plays, and stories,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
taught him to suppress relentlessly all his unformed
work, until, full panoplied, he sprang into
being as a brilliant maker of artistic fictions.</p>

<p>His later years—he died by his own hand in
1893 at the age of forty-three—were darkened
by the approaching madness which he so terribly
pictures in “The Horla.” In <em>Bel Ami</em> he
writes:</p>

<p>“There comes a day, you know, when no matter
what you are looking at, you see Death lurking
behind it.... As for me, for the last fifteen
years I have felt the torment of it, as if I were
carrying a gnawing beast. I have felt it dragging
me down, little by little, month by month, hour
by hour, like a house that is crumbling away....
Each step I take brings me nearer to it, every
moment that passes, every breath I draw, hurries
on its odious work.... Breathing, sleeping,
eating, drinking, working, dreaming,—everything
we do is simply dying by inches.... Now I see
it so near that I often stretch out my arm to
thrust it back!”</p>

<p>But under the shadow of this terrible phantasm
as he was, latterly his cold, unsympathetic scrutiny
of men and things had warmed somewhat,
and his latest writings—his productive period
covers only about ten intensely active years—show
more gentleness, more sympathy with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
struggling humanity. But never did he really
depart from the morbid and cynical view of life,
and the horror of death as the final breakdown of
all things desirable, which showed so plainly in
most of his fictions.</p>

<p>If we see but little of Guy de Maupassant’s
life in his writings, it is to them we must turn to
discover his temperament and his philosophy—glimpses
of which we have already had.</p>

<p>Absolutely French, almost a typical Latin,
Maupassant was not unemotional; he merely
refused to allow <em>his</em> emotions to color the characters
he delineated. He was himself a passionate
pleasure-seeker, determined to extract the last
drop of satisfaction from life, but he erred in
thinking that one may at the same time drain the
cup of mental joys and that of physical pleasures.
What wonder that this vampire, in love with the
blood of life, should suck final poison whence he
had thought to draw only pulsing bliss. His very
repressions supplied power for each fresh explosion
of private excess—yet always the cold precision
of his artistry grew, until the perfection of
his chiselling left critics wordless. The deft
maker of word-masterpieces never lost the artist
in the man.</p>

<p>According to this warped genius, life was intended
to amuse, to gratify self. Inner beauty he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
scouted—the beauty of the seen he adored. For
such a nature the ideal existed only as a foolish
figment. Even ideal love he scouted, depicting
with relentless fidelity the sins of a mother as
discovered by her loving children, the universal
laxity of the Norman peasants as condoned by
complacent priests, the ravishing of every illusion,
the degradation of every virtue. What
other conclusion was there for so sad, so hopeless,
so pitiless, so materialistic, a philosophy, than
<em>What’s the use!</em></p>

<p>But if there was little of apparent beauty in our
author’s character, it is impossible not to admire
his industry, his will, his passionate devotion to a
perfect art, his relentless literary fidelity to truth
as he saw it, his magic mastery of diction and of
dialogue, his incisive though unmoral analysis of
character and life, his constant advance in craftsmanship
to the end. To turn out something
beautiful in form was to him worth a lifetime of
effort. How great would he have grown had his
eyes been opened to the inner light!</p>

<p>I have chosen his <em>Clair de Lune</em> for presentation
here because it more nearly approaches
spiritual beauty than any other of his stories.
It needs no commentary—it speaks its own
beauties in tones subtly delicate yet silver clear.</p>

<p class="big1 center">(<em>CLAIR DE LUNE</em>)</p>

<p class="big2 center">By Guy de Maupassant</p>

<p class="p2b center"><em>Done into English by the Editor</em></p>


<p>The Abbé Marignan bore well his title of
Soldier of the Church. He was a tall priest,
and spare; fanatical, perpetually in a state of
spiritual exaltation, but upright of soul. His
every belief was settled, without even a thought
of wavering. He imagined sincerely that he
understood his God thoroughly, that he penetrated
His designs, His will, His purposes.</p>

<p>As with long strides he promenaded the garden
walk of his little country presbytery, sometimes
a question would arise in his mind: “Why did
God create that?” And, mentally taking the
place of God, he searched obstinately for the
answer—and nearly always found it. It would
not have been like him to murmur, in an outburst
of pious humility: “O Lord, thy designs are impenetrable!”
Rather might he say to himself:
“I am the servant of God; I ought to know the
reasons for what He does, or if I know them not,
I ought to divine them.”</p>

<p>To him, all nature seemed created with a logic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
as absolute as it was admirable. The “wherefore”
and the “because” always corresponded
perfectly. Dawn was made to gladden our
waking, the day to ripen the crops, the rain to
water them, the evening to prepare for slumber,
and the night darkened for sleep.</p>

<p>The four seasons met perfectly all the needs of
agriculture; and to the priest it was quite inconceivable
that nature had no designs, and that, on
the contrary, all living things were subjects of
the same inexorable laws of period, climate, and
matter.</p>

<p>But he did hate woman! He hated her unconscionably,
and by instinct held her in contempt.
Often did he repeat the words of Christ,
“Woman, what have I to do with thee?” And
he would add, “One might think that God Himself
did not feel quite content with this one work
of his hands!” To him, indeed, woman was the
child twelve times unclean of whom the poet
speaks. She was the temptress who had ensnared
the first man, and who constantly kept up her
work of damnation—she was a feeble, dangerous,
and mysteriously troublous creature. And even
more than her accursed body did he hate her
loving spirit.</p>

<p>He had often felt that women were regarding
him tenderly, and even though he knew himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
to be invulnerable, it exasperated him to recognize
that need for loving which fluttered ever-present
in their hearts.</p>

<p>In his opinion, God had created woman only to
tempt man and to test him. She should never be
even approached without those defensive measures
which one would take, and those fears
which one would harbor, when nearing a trap.
In fact, she was precisely like a trap, with her lips
open and arms extended towards man.</p>

<p>Only toward nuns did he exercise any indulgence,
for they were rendered harmless by their
vow. But he treated them harshly just the same,
because, ever-living in the depths of their pent-up
and humbled hearts, he discerned that everlasting
tenderness which constantly surged up toward
him, priest though he was.</p>

<p>Of all this he was conscious in their upturned
glances, more limpid with pious feeling than the
looks of monks; in the spiritual exaltations
in which their sex indulged; in their ecstasies
of love toward Christ, which made the priest
indignant because it was really woman’s
love, carnal love. Of this detestable tenderness
he was conscious, too, in their very
docility, in the gentleness of their voices when they
addressed him, in their downcast eyes, and in their
submissive tears when he rudely rebuked them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>So he would shake his cassock when he left the
convent door, and stride off, stretching his legs
as if fleeing before some danger.</p>

<p>Now the Abbé had a niece who lived with her
mother in a little house near by. He was determined
to make of her a sister of charity.</p>

<p>She was pretty, giddy, and a born tease. When
he preached at her, she laughed; and when he
became angry with her, she kissed him vehemently,
pressing him to her bosom, while he
would instinctively seek to disengage himself
from this embrace—which, all the same, gave him
a thrill of exquisite joy, awaking deep within his
soul that feeling of fatherhood which slumbers in
every man.</p>

<p>Often as they walked together along the footpaths
through the fields, he would talk with her
of God, of his God; but she scarcely heard him,
for she was looking at the sky, the grass, the
flowers, with a joy of life which beamed from her
eyes. Sometimes she would dart away to catch
some flying creature, crying as she brought it
back: “See, my uncle, how pretty it is; I should
like to kiss it.” And that passion to kiss insects,
or lilac flowers, disturbed, irritated, and repelled
the priest, who recognized even in that longing
the ineradicable love which blooms perennial in
the heart of woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>And now one day the sacristan’s wife, who was
the Abbé Marignan’s housekeeper, cautiously
told him that his niece had a lover!</p>

<p>He was dreadfully shocked, and stood gasping
for breath, lather all over his face, for he was
shaving.</p>

<p>When at length he was able to think and speak,
he cried: “It is not true. You are lying,
Mélanie!”</p>

<p>But the peasant woman laid her hand over her
heart: “May our Lord judge me if I am lying,
<em>monsieur le curé</em>. I tell you she goes out to him
every night as soon as your sister is in bed. They
meet each other down by the river. You need
only go there between ten o’clock and midnight
to see for yourself.”</p>

<p>He stopped rubbing his chin and began pacing
the room violently, as was his custom in times of
serious thought. When at length he did try to
finish his shaving he cut himself three times, from
nose to ear.</p>

<p>All day long he was silent, though almost exploding
with indignation and wrath. To his
priestly rage against the power of love was now
added the indignation of a spiritual father, of a
teacher, of the guardian of souls, who has been
deceived, robbed, and trifled with by a mere
child. He felt that egotistical suffocation which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
parents experience when their daughter tells them
that she has selected a husband without their advice
and in defiance of their wishes.</p>

<p>After dinner he tried to read a little, but he
could not—he grew more and more exasperated.
When the clock struck ten, he grasped his cane,
a formidable oaken club which he always carried
when he went out at night to visit the sick. With
a smile he examined this huge cudgel, gripped it
in his solid, countryman’s fist, and flourished it
menacingly in the air. Then, suddenly, with
grinding teeth, he brought it down upon a chair-back,
which fell splintered to the floor.</p>

<p>He opened his door to go out; but paused upon
the threshold, surprised by such a glory of moonlight
as one rarely sees.</p>

<p>And as he was endowed with an exalted soul
of such a sort as the Fathers of the Church, those
poetic seers, must have possessed, he became suddenly
entranced, moved by the grand and tranquil
beauty of the pale-faced night.</p>

<p>In his little garden, all suffused with the tender
radiance, his fruit-trees, set in rows, outlined in
shadows upon the paths their slender limbs of
wood, scarce clothed with verdure. The giant
honeysuckle, clinging to the house wall, exhaled
its delicious, honeyed breath—the soul of perfume
seemed to hover about in the warm, clear night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>He began to breathe deep, drinking in the air
as drunkards drink their wine; and he walked
slowly, ravished, amazed, his niece almost forgotten.</p>

<p>When he reached the open country he paused
to gaze upon the broad sweep of landscape, all
deluged by that caressing radiance, all drowned
in that soft and sensuous charm of peaceful night.
Momently the frogs sounded out their quick
metallic notes, and distant nightingales added to
the seductive moonlight their welling music, which
charms to dreams without thought—that gossamer,
vibrant melody born only to mate with kisses.</p>

<p>The Abbé moved on again, his courage unaccountably
failing. He felt as though he were
enfeebled, suddenly exhausted—he longed to sit
down, to linger there, to glorify God for all His
works.</p>

<p>A little farther on, following the winding of the
little river, curved a row of tall poplars. Suspended
about and above the banks, enwrapping
the whole sinuous course of the stream with a sort
of light transparent down, was a fine white mist,
shot through by the moon-rays, and transmuted
by them into gleaming silver.</p>

<p>The priest paused once again, stirred to the
deeps of his soul by a growing, an irresistible feeling
of tenderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>And a doubt, an undefined disquietude,
crept over him; he discerned the birth of one of
those questions which now and again came to him.</p>

<p>Why had God made all this? Since the night
was ordained for slumber, for unconsciousness,
for repose, for forgetfulness of everything, why
should He make it lovelier than the day, sweeter
than dawn and sunset? And that star, slow-moving,
seductive, more poetic than the sun, so
like to destiny, and so delicate that seemingly
it was created to irradiate things too subtle, too
refined, for the greater orb—why was it come to
illuminate all the shades?</p>

<p>Why did not the most accomplished of all singing
birds repose now like the others, instead of
singing in the unquiet dark?</p>

<p>Why was this semi-veil cast over the world?
Why this sighing of the heart, this tumult of the
soul, this languor of the flesh?</p>

<p>Why this show of charms, never seen by men
because they are asleep? For whose eyes was all
this sublime spectacle designed, all this wealth of
poetic loveliness diffused from heaven over the
earth?</p>

<p>And the Abbé did not understand it at all.</p>

<p>But there below, at the very edge of the field,
under the arching trees wet with luminous mist,
two shadows appeared, walking side by side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>The man was the taller, and had his arm about
his sweetheart’s neck; and from time to time he
bent to kiss her forehead. Suddenly they animated
the lifeless landscape, which enveloped their
figures like a divine frame fashioned expressly
for them. They seemed, those two, like a single
being, the being for whom was created this tranquil,
silent night. Like a living answer, the
answer which his Master had sent to his question,
they moved toward the priest.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed, his heart throbbing, he stood
still, and it seemed as though there spread before
him some Biblical scene, like the loves of Ruth
and Boaz, the working out of the Lord’s will in
one of those majestic dramas set forth in the lives
of the saints. The verses of the Song of Songs,
the ardent cries, the call of the body—all the
glowing romance of that poem so aflame with tenderness
and love, began to sing itself into his mind.</p>

<p>And he said to himself: “Perhaps God made
nights such as this in order to cast the veil of the
ideal over the loves of men.”</p>

<p>He withdrew before this pair who went ever
arm in arm. True, it was his niece; but now he
asked himself if he had not been upon the verge of
disobeying God. And, indeed, if God did not
permit love, why did he visibly encompass it with
glory such as this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>And he fled, bewildered, almost ashamed, as if
he had penetrated into a temple wherein he had
no right to enter.</p>

</p><h2 class="nobreak p2b">ALPHONSE DAUDET, MAN AND ARTIST</h2>
</div>


<p>When the gods parceled out their gifts, to
Alphonse Daudet fell a rich endowment:
a poet’s imaginative nature, yet withal a clear
vision for realities which is often denied the disciple
of poesy; a sure dramatic instinct, too, with
a contrasting power of repression which checked
his slightest tendency toward the florid and the
melodramatic; and, coloring all, a native sense of
humor so tenderly sympathetic that it prevented
his satire from biting with that acid sharpness of
which his wit was capable. An all-round, well-poised
literary genius was he, efficient in many
fields, and preëminent in more than one.</p>

<p>There is one word of all the happy many which,
in the opinion of all his critics, fitly characterizes
Daudet—he possessed charm, charm of manner
personally and charm of literary style. I wish his
portrait were before us here, that we might trace
in that striking countenance the record of those
fascinating qualities of mind and heart which are
so patent in his life and work.</p>

<p>As for his person, from boyhood his hair grew
in that untamed profusion which we so often
associate with strong individuality, and even in
later life he wore his locks long and full. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
beard was silky, and unrestrained rather than
unkempt. Near-sighted eyes, peering from behind
the inevitable black-rimmed <em>pince nez</em>, or
at times a monocle, seemed curious and inquiring,
typifying perfectly the spirit of naïve interest
with which he looked out on life to observe its
myriad moods and forms. In this look there was
something reflective, too, as though he had just
noticed a matter of unusual interest, and was
inwardly speculating upon its further meanings.
The nose was pleasure-loving, though robust,
dignified, and individual—counteracted upon by
the satirical mouth, whose sarcasm, in turn, was
gently toned by twinkling furrows that flanked
his eyes. In later days the sharpness of Daudet’s
expression of mouth had been almost lost, and a
gentle detachment, betokening a just but sympathetic
critical spirit, marked his countenance and
made it less keen than lovable. Yet it was in
those later years that his cherished hatred for the
French Academy led to the bitter satirical outburst
against that institution in his novel, <em>The
Immortal</em> (1888). But that was only one phase
temporarily dominant in the man whom everyone
loved and who himself loved all.</p>

<p>Alphonse Daudet was—especially in youth—the
exponent of the south, the south as typified
by his native Provence. His was the rich, effusive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
impressionable southland nature—abundantly
moved upon by all the southern charm and
vivacity and naïveté and life, as well as richly
gifted in the ability to reproduce those impressions
in the pages of his writings. Then what
more natural than that he should both personally
and in his fiction embody the vivid life of the carefree
land? When, in 1869, his first important
volume of collected stories appeared, it was seen
that into <em>Letters from My Mill</em>—which included
“The Pope’s Mule”—Daudet had poured not
only the young unspoiled richness of his own
buoyancy, but also the fulness of his feeling for
local landscapes, traditions, and characters of
town and country. And again and again, even in
his later work, Daudet reverts to the scenes of his
boyhood life, and gives us pictures—now jocund
as the wine of the country, now sad as a poet’s
wail—whose tone and spirit are of the Provençal
life, all delicately set in the atmosphere of that
sunny clime.</p>

<p>In the <em>History of My Books</em>, which forms an
integral part of the author’s <em>Thirty Years in Paris</em>,
he takes us by the hand in his dear, intimate way
and shows us the great white house, the ancient
and unique manor of Montauban. Near by, its
shattered wings swaying in the wind on the summit
of a little pine-clad mountain, stands <em>Mon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Moulin</em>—the windmill about whose dusty portals
for centuries had gathered the quaint characters
of the district, and where, now that its traffic was
forever departed, the young Alphonse first began
to distinguish man from man in the stories told
him by the ancients of the province.</p>

<p>“Excellent people, blessed house!” he writes.
“How often have I repaired thither in the winter
to recuperate in the embrace of nature, to heal
myself of Paris and its fevers in the wholesome
emanations of our little Provençal hills.”</p>

<p>The greetings of old friends at an end, he would
whistle to Miracle, a venerable spaniel some
fisherman had once found on a bit of wreckage
at sea, and climb up to his mill, there
to browse and dream and wander in fancy
whithersoever the spirits of the place should
beckon.</p>

<p>“The mill was a ruin,” he says; “a crumbling
mass of stone, iron, and ancient boards which had
not turned in the wind for many years, and which
lay, with broken limbs, as useless as a poet, while
all around on the hillside the miller’s trade prospered
and ground and ground with all its wings.
Strange affinities subsist between ourselves and
inanimate objects. From the first day, that
cast-off structure was dear to my heart; I loved
it for its desolation, its road overgrown with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
weeds, those little grayish, fragrant mountain
weeds with which Père Gaucher compounded his
elixir; for its little worn platform where it was so
pleasant to loiter, sheltered from the wind, while
a rabbit hurried by, or a long snake, rustling
among the leaves with crafty detours, hunted the
field mice with which the ruin swarmed. With
the creaking of the old building shaken by the
north wind, the flapping of its wings like the rigging
of a ship at sea, the mill stirred in my poor,
restless, nomadic brain memories of journeys by
sea, of landings at lighthouses and far-off islands;
and the shivering swell all about completed the
illusion. I know not whence I derived this taste
for wild and desert places which has characterized
me from my childhood, and which seems so inconsistent
with the exuberance of my nature,
unless it be at the same time the physical need of
repairing by a fast from words, by abstinence
from outcries and gestures, the terrible waste
which the southerner makes of his whole being.
Be that as it may, I owe a great deal to those
places of refuge for the mind; and no one of them
has been more salutary in its effect upon me than
that old mill in Provence.”</p>

<p>Here, both in boyhood and in young manhood’s
revisitations, Daudet found the “grasshopper’s
library,” and in its secret alcoves discovered such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
delightful stories as “The Elixir of the Reverend
Father Gaucher,” “The Three Low Masses,”
“The Goat of Monsieur Seguin,” “Master Cornille’s
Secret,” and “The Old Folks,” all abounding
in naïve character and told with his own delicate
charm. Here, too, he learned to take a
delight in his craft which waned not with the
years; and to find joy in pleasing “the people,”
who were ever the subjects of his finest delineations.</p>

<p>Born at Nîmes in 1840, and as a mere lad leaving
home for the city of Lyons, Daudet’s public
career began with his journey to Paris in November,
1857. The boy of seventeen and a half
came possessed of a slender collection of poems
which, though the product of so youthful a
rhymester, met with no little favor. In manner
common to those who must win their way along
the precarious paths of letters, he pressed on,
until in 1859—he being not yet twenty—Daudet
published his first volume of poems, <em>Les
Amoureuses</em>, which won high praise from the
critics, but is now sought chiefly by collectors.
Thus he began to gain confidence, and others of
his works followed almost yearly. The pages of
<em>Le Figaro</em> were now freely opened to him, and that
public by whom he never ceased to be loved began
to scan its columns for his fantastic chronicles of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
Provençal life. In that same journal he began in
1866 to publish his <em>Letters from My Mill</em>, which
were collected in volume form in 1869, and constituted
his first real popular triumph.</p>

<p>The third period in our author’s life is marked
by the sad experiences of the Siege of Paris, in
1870. Just as his life in the south inspired the
<em>Letters</em>, so did the grave impressions made by
those terrible days in the French capital during
the Franco-Prussian War move him to write the
little masterpieces which, in part, appeared in the
volume entitled <em>Monday Tales</em>, published in 1873.
Who that has read them can forget the “piercing
pathos” of “The Last Class” and “The Siege of
Berlin”? Not only are these human episodes of
singularly tender appeal, but they are masterpieces
of form, unsurpassed among short-stories
of any language. As Daudet’s best work, they
deserve further notice here.</p>

<p>At the close of the Franco-Prussian War, Alsace
and Lorraine were ceded to Germany by France.
One of the edicts issued by the conquerors, with
a view to nationalizing the acquired territory,
was that the French language should no longer
be taught in their public schools. And this furnishes
the <em>motif</em> for Daudet’s “The Last Class.”</p>

<p>The story is simply told in the first person by
Frantz, a little Alsatian. Frantz recalls that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
historic day when he set off for school a little late.
Hoping that he might perhaps escape the teacher’s
ferrule, he cuts across the public square without
even stopping to find out the meaning of the knot
of perturbed villagers who are discussing an
announcement upon the bulletin board in front
of the mayor’s office. As he slips into his seat,
hoping to escape observation, he is impressed
by the unnatural quiet in the school-room, and
also by the presence of a number of the town
notables, all solemnly garbed in holiday dress.</p>

<p>The lad marvels that he is not even chided for
his lateness, and is more than ever mystified as
the schoolmaster proceeds with one lesson and
another, all under stress of deep emotion.</p>

<p>By and by the schoolmaster tells his pupils of
the cruel edict, and Frantz begins to realize that
the worthy master will no longer rule in his
accustomed place. He becomes conscious of
neglected work, and a whole tide of better resolutions
surges in his breast. Finally the master
has heard the last class and arising seeks utterance
for his farewells. At first he is able to give his
pupils some sound advice, but at length no words
will come, and with such quiverings of lip as even
Daudet tries not to depict, he chokes, swiftly
turns to the blackboard, takes a piece of chalk,
and, bearing with all his might, dashes off his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
final expression of patriotic protest and personal
sorrow:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>VIVE LA FRANCE!</p>
</div>

<p>“Then he stood there, with his head resting
against the wall, and without speaking, he motioned
to us with his hand:</p>

<p>“'That is all; go.’”</p>

<p>On rereading “The Last Class” for the dozenth
time, I find that it is surrounded with an emotional
atmosphere which, textually, the story does
not contain. I think this must be the aura
emanating from the spirit of the story; for a
great work of fiction is not only the product of
emotion, but it kindles emotion, because it is
a creation, an entity, a living being. Doubtless
the contention could not be demonstrated
that, when properly received, a great work
of fictional art will arouse the same emotions
in the reader as were first enkindled in the
breast of its author when the story was born.
None the less, I believe it to be true. What feelings,
then, must Daudet have known when he
gave forth this little master-story! It must be
these that I myself feel, for I do not, by analysis,
find them all present in the text, even by suggestion.
Happy artist, who can so project the creations
of his soul that they henceforth live and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
expand and communicate their messages to
multitudes to him unknown! So all great fiction
is alive; so lives the work of Alphonse Daudet.</p>

<p>The emotion in “The Siege of Berlin” is of a
different type. It, too, finds its <em>motif</em> in the
Franco-Prussian War; this time in the Siege of
Paris itself.</p>

<p>An invalided old cuirassier of the First Empire,
Colonel Jouve, lies in his room in the Champs-Élysées,
fronting the Arc de Triomphe. Day by
day his grand-daughter brings to him news of the
progress of the war. So fully is his life wrapped
up in the success of the French armies that, in
order to brighten his closing days, they tell him
fictitious stories of his compatriots’ success. But
one day, when the enemy’s lines have drawn close
about the beleaguered capital and the end is at
hand, it becomes difficult to deceive the old
soldier any longer. Still, fresh victories are
always supplied by the news-bureau of love, and
the old man can scarcely wait for the homecoming
of the victorious battalions. So when
one day the sound of bugle and drum is heard,
and the tramp of marching feet beneath the
windows of the upper room, you can picture the
delight of this old veteran. With a superhuman
effort he leaves his bed and looks out of the window—only
to see the Prussian troops instead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
the cheering cohorts of his countrymen! And in
this last pang of disappointment, the old man dies.</p>

<p>Both of these stories end with the note of
disappointment and consequent sorrow. Poe has
declared that the tone of beauty is sadness, and
surely there is a penetrating beauty as well as a
thrill of sublimity in the sadness of these wonderfully-wrought
episodes. Here may be seen the
beginnings of the realistic method which Daudet
later adopted. Yet, as these stories both indicate,
he still carried with him the romanticism of his
earlier inspirations, untouched by either the too
painful naturalism or the sentimentality of some
of his later stories.</p>

<p>In still greater contrast than either of these to
the other is the story of our present translation,
“The Pope’s Mule.” Here are all the joyous
satire, the rollicking fun-making, and the picturesque
description, of this unexcelled interpreter
of southern life. Daudet’s wit and humor, characterization
and description, local color, kaleidoscopic
pageantry, are at their best, with never a
thought of enforcing a moral or of sounding any
emotion deeper than that of boyish amusement.
It is the creator of Tartarin who now writes, and
not the later master of the novelist’s art.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the success of the fecund and
versatile author of <em>Sapho</em>, as a playwright, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
his much wider vogue as a novelist, I wonder if
after all he did not love best his short-stories and
prose fantasies. In his greatest real novels,
<em>Froment, Jr., and Risler, Sr.</em>; <em>Jack</em>; <em>The Nabob</em>;
<em>Kings in Exile</em>; and <em>Numa Roumestan</em>, the episode
often occurs, of which literary form some
further words will be said in the treatment of Loti.</p>

<p>Such a temperament as Daudet’s, both introspective
and finely sensitive to the impressions
of his surroundings, would naturally make much
of his fiction biographical, and even autobiographical.
Indeed, a close study of his works, read in
the light of his life, shows how he has woven into
his stories many personal facts. In that exquisite
child-document <em>Little What’s-His-Name</em>, we have
a rather full record of his boyhood and entrance
into Paris. <em>Jack</em>, also, is full of his own early
sorrows, while one character after another may
be traced to folk whom he knew. His mind, and
his heart too, were note-books on which he was
always transcribing his impressions of life, and—here
is the vital thing, after all—recreating them
for use in his own inimitable way.</p>

<p>So Daudet was not an extreme realist—scarcely
a typical realist at all—for while he used the
realistic method for observation and faithful
record, he no more got beyond sympathizing with
his characters than did Dickens, to whom more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
than to any other English-writing novelist he
must be compared. Daudet “belonged” to no
school, expounded no theories, stood for no reforms.
He was just a kindly, humorous, sympathetic,
patiently exact maker of fascinating
fictions, and as such we shall love him quite in the
proportion that we know him. Life, as he saw it,
was full of sadness, but that did not make him
conclude it to be not worth the living. Happily
married, he knew the solaces of home life. Unlike
Maupassant, “What’s the use!” was far from
being the heart of his philosophy. Disenchanted
with life he never was. A disheartening view of
sordidness, vice, and misery left him still with
open eyes, for he would not close them against
truth; but it never prevented his turning his gaze
upon the beautiful, the humorous, and the good—a
lovable trio ever!—and finding in them some
healing for his hurt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE POPE’S MULE</h2>
</div>

<p class="big1 center">(<em>LA MULE DU PAPE</em>)</p>

<p class="big2 center">By Alphonse Daudet</p>

<p class="p2b center"><em>Done into English by the Editor</em></p>


<p>Of all the pretty sayings, proverbs, or adages
with which our Provence peasants embroider
their discourse, I know none more picturesque
or singular than this: within fifteen
leagues around about my mill, whenever a person
speaks of a spiteful, vindictive man, he says,
“That man there—look out for him! He is like
the Pope’s mule, who kept her kick in waiting for
seven years.”</p>

<p>I hunted diligently for a long time to find out
whence that proverb could have come, what was
that papal mule, and that kick reserved throughout
seven years. No one here has been able to
inform me on this subject, not even Francet
Mamaï, my fife player, though he has all the
Provençal legends at his fingers’ ends. Francet
thinks with me that it must be founded upon some
old tradition of Provence; yet he has never heard
it referred to except in this proverb.</p>

<p>“You will not find that anywhere but in the
Library of the Grasshoppers,” said the old fifer
to me, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>The idea struck me as a good one, and since the
Library of the Grasshoppers is at my door, I
went and shut myself up there for a week.</p>

<p>It is a marvellous library, admirably equipped,
open to poets day and night, and attended by
little librarians who constantly make music for
you with cymbals. There I passed some delicious
days, and, after a week of research—on my back—I
ended by discovering what I wished to know,
that is to say, the history of my mule and of that
famous kick saved up for seven years. The story
is a pretty one, although a trifle naïve, and I am
going to try to tell it you just as I read it yesterday
morning in a sky-colored manuscript, which
smelled delightfully of dry lavender, and had long
gossamer threads for binding threads.</p>

<p>He who has never seen the Avignon of the time
of the Popes, has seen nothing. For gayety, for
life, for animation, for a succession of fêtes, there
never was a city its equal. From morning till
night there were processions and pilgrimages;
streets strewn with flowers and hung with rich
tapestries; cardinals arriving by the Rhône,
banners flying, galleys bedecked with flags; papal
soldiers chanting in Latin on the public squares;
begging friars with their alms-rattles; then, in
addition, from roof to cellar of the houses which
swarmed humming around the great papal palace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
like bees about their hive, there were heard the
<em>tic-tac</em> of the lace-makers’ looms, the flying of the
shuttles weaving cloth-of-gold for vestments, the
little hammers of the vase-sculptors, the keyboards
being attuned at the lute-makers’, the
songs of the warpers; and, overhead, the booming
of the bells was heard, and always below sounded
the tinkle of the tambourines on the river bank
by the bridge. For with us, when the people are
happy they must be dancing, dancing ever; and
since in those days the streets in the city were too
narrow for the farandole, fifers and tambourine
players took up their post upon the Avignon
Bridge, in the cool breezes of the Rhône, and day
and night they danced and danced.... Ah!
happy time, happy city, when halberds did not
wound, and state prisons were used only for cooling
wine! No famine; no wars! That shows the
way the Popes of the Comtat<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> knew how to govern
their people; that is why their people
regretted them so deeply!</p>

<p>There was one Pope especially, a good old
gentleman whom they called Boniface. Ah! how
many tears were shed for him in Avignon when
he died! He was such an amiable, affable prince!
He would smile down at you so genially from his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>mule! And when you passed him—whether you
were a poor little digger of madder or the grand
provost of the city—he would give you his benediction
so courteously! A genuine Pope of Yvetot
was he, but of an Yvetot in Provence, with something
sly in his laughter, a sprig of sweet marjoram
in his cap—and not the semblance of a Jeanneton.
The only Jeanneton the good Father had ever
been known to have was his vineyard—a little
vineyard which he had planted himself, three
leagues from Avignon, among the myrtles of
Château-Neuf.</p>

<p>Every Sunday, on going out from vespers, the
worthy man went to pay his court to it, and when
he was seated in the grateful sun, his mule close
beside him, his cardinals stretched at the foot of
the vine stocks all about, then he would order a
flagon of wine of his own bottling—that exquisite,
ruby-colored wine, which has been called ever
since Château-Neuf of the Popes—and he would
drink it appreciatively in little sips, and regard
his vineyard with a tender air. Then—the flagon
empty, the day closed—he would return joyously
to the city, followed by all his chapter; and, after
crossing the Bridge of Avignon, in the midst of
drum-beats and farandoles, his mule, stirred by
the music, took up a little skipping amble, while
he himself marked the time of the dance with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
cap—a thing which greatly scandalized his cardinals,
but caused all the people to say,
“Ah! that good prince! Ah! that fine old
Pope!”</p>

<p>Next to his vineyard at Château-Neuf, the
thing that the Pope loved best in the world was
his mule. The good old man doted on that beast.
Every evening before going to bed he went to see
if her stable was well shut, if nothing was lacking
in the manger; and he never rose from the table
without having had prepared under his very eyes
a huge bowl of wine <em>à la Française</em>, with plenty of
sugar and spice, which he himself carried to the
mule, despite the remarks of his cardinals. It
must be admitted, however, that the animal was
worth the trouble. She was a beautiful mule,
black and dappled with red, glossy of coat, sure
of foot, large and full of back, and carrying
proudly her neat little head, all decked out with
pompons, rosettes, silver bells, and bows of ribbon—all
this with the mildness of an angel, a naïve
eye, and two long ears, always in motion, which
gave her the air of an amiable child. All Avignon
respected her, and when she went through the
streets there was no attention which she did not
receive; for everyone knew that this was the best
way to be in favor at court, and that, for all her
innocent air, the Pope’s mule had led more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
one to fortune—witness Tistet Védène and his
prodigious adventure.</p>

<p>This Tistet Védène was, from the very first, an
audacious young rascal whom his father, Guy
Védène, the gold-carver, had been obliged to drive
from home because he would not do anything,
and demoralized the apprentices. For six months
he could be seen trailing his jacket through all
the gutters of Avignon, but especially around the
papal palace, for this rascal had long had his eye
fixed on the Pope’s mule, and you will see what a
villainous scheme it was. One day when his Holiness
was taking a walk all alone beneath the
shadows of the ramparts with his steed, behold
my Tistet approached and, clasping his hands
with an air of admiration, said to him:</p>

<p>“Ah! <em>mon Dieu!</em> what a splendid mule you
have there, Holy Father! Permit me to look at
her a moment. Ah, my Pope, the emperor of
Germany has not her equal!”</p>

<p>And he caressed her and spoke softly to her, as
to a damsel.</p>

<p>“Come here, my jewel, my treasure, my fine
pearl....”</p>

<p>And the good Pope, deeply moved, said to
himself:</p>

<p>“What a good little fellow! How gentle he is
with my mule!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>And do you know what happened the next day?
Tistet Védène exchanged his old yellow jacket for
a beautiful vestment of lace, a violet silk hood,
and buckled shoes; and he entered the household
of the Pope, where never before had any been received
but sons of nobles and nephews of
cardinals. There is an intrigue for you! But
Tistet did not stop there.</p>

<p>Once in the service of the Pope, the rascal
continued the game which had succeeded so well.
Insolent with everyone else, he had nothing but
attention, nothing but provident care for the
mule; and one was always meeting him about the
palace court with a handful of oats or a bunch of
clover, whose rosy clusters he shook gently and
glanced at the balcony of Saint Peter as if to say:
“Ha! for whom is this?” And so it went on until
the good Pope, who felt that he was growing old,
ended by leaving it to him to watch over the
stable and to carry to the mule her bowl of wine
<em>à la Française</em>—which was no laughing matter
for the cardinals.</p>

<p>No more was it for the mule—it did not make
her laugh. Now, at the hour for her wine, she
always saw coming to her stable five or six little
clerks of the household, who hastily buried themselves
in the straw with their hoods and their
laces; then, after a moment, a delicious warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
odor of caramel and spices filled the stable, and
Tistet Védène appeared carefully carrying the
bowl of wine <em>à la Française</em>. Then the martyrdom
of the poor beast began.</p>

<p>That perfumed wine which she loved so well,
which kept her warm, which gave her wings, they
had the cruelty to place before her, there in her
manger, and let her sniff it; then, when she had
her nostrils full of it, it was gone—that lovely
rose-flamed liquor all went down the gullets of
those good-for-nothings. And yet if they had
only stopped at taking her wine; but they were
like devils, all these little clerks, when they had
drunken. One pulled her ears, another her tail;
Quinquet mounted himself upon her back,
Béluguet tried his cap on her, and not one of those
little scamps reflected that with a single good kick
that excellent beast could have sent them all into
the polar star, and even farther. But no! It is
no vain thing to be the Pope’s mule, the mule of
benedictions and indulgences. The children went
blithely on, she did not get angry; and it was only
against Tistet Védène that she bore malice. But
that fellow, for instance, when she felt him behind
her, her hoof itched, and truly she had excellent
reason. That ne’er-do-well of a Tistet played her
such villainous tricks! He had such cruel fancies
after drinking!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>One day he took it into his head to make her
climb up with him into the clock tower, all the
way up to the very top of the palace! And it is
no myth that I am telling you—two hundred
thousand Provençals saw it. Imagine for yourself
the terror of that unhappy mule when, after
having for a whole hour twisted like a snail blindly
up the staircase, and having clambered up I know
not how many steps, she found herself all at once
on a platform dazzling with light, and saw, a
thousand feet beneath her, a fantastic Avignon:
the market booths no larger than walnuts, the
papal soldiers before their barracks like red ants,
and farther down, over a silver thread, a microscopically
little bridge on which the people danced
and danced. Ah! poor beast! What panic! At
the bray she uttered all the windows of the palace
trembled.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What are they doing to
her?” cried the good Pope, and rushed out upon
the balcony.</p>

<p>Tistet Védène was already in the courtyard,
pretending to weep and tear out his hair.</p>

<p>“Ah! Holy Father, what is the matter? There
is your mule.... <em>Mon Dieu!</em> what will happen
to us! Your mule has gone up into the belfry!”</p>

<p>“All by herself?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Holy Father, all by herself. Stay!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
Look there, up high. Don’t you see her ears
waving? They look like two swallows.”</p>

<p>“Mercy on us!” cried the poor Pope on raising
his eyes. “But she must have gone mad! Why,
she will kill herself. Will you come down, you
unhappy creature!”</p>

<p><em>Pécaïre!</em> She could have asked nothing better
than to come down; but how? The stairs—they
were not to be thought of: one could mount those
things, but as to coming down, one could break
one’s legs a hundred times. And the poor mule
was disconsolate; but as she roamed about the
platform with her great eyes filled with vertigo
she thought of Tistet Védène.</p>

<p>“Ah, bandit, if I escape—what a kick tomorrow
morning!”</p>

<p>That idea of a kick restored a little courage to
her heart; except for that she could not have held
out. At last they succeeded in getting her down,
but it was not an easy affair. They had to lower
her in a litter, with ropes and windlass, and you
may imagine what a humiliation it must have
been for a Pope’s mule to see herself hanging at
that height, afloat with her legs in the air like a
beetle at the end of a string. And all Avignon
looking on!</p>

<p>The unhappy beast did not sleep that night.
It seemed to her as though she were forever turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
upon that accursed platform, with the
laughter of the city below. Then she thought of
that infamous Tistet Védène, and of the delightful
kick that she proposed to turn loose the next
morning. Ah, my friends, what a kick! They
could see the smoke at Pampérigouste.</p>

<p>But, while this pretty reception was being
prepared for him at the stable, do you know what
Tistet Védène was doing? He was going singing
down the Rhône on one of the papal galleys, on
his way to the Court of Naples with a company
of young nobles whom the city sent every year to
Queen Joanna for exercise in diplomacy and in
manners. Tistet was not of noble birth; but the
Pope desired to recompense him for what he had
done for his mule, and above all for the activity
he had shown throughout the day of the rescue.</p>

<p>It was the mule who was disappointed the next
day!</p>

<p>“Ah, the bandit! He suspected something!”
she thought as she shook her bells in fury. “But
it’s all the same; go, scoundrel! You will find it
waiting for you on your return, that kick—I’ll
save it for you!”</p>

<p>And she did save it.</p>

<p>After the departure of Tistet, the Pope’s mule
once more found her course of tranquil life and her
former habits. Neither Quinquet nor Béluguet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
came again to her stable. The delightful days of
wine <em>à la Française</em> had returned, and with them
good-humor, the long siestas, and the little prancing
step when she crossed the Avignon bridge.
However, since her adventure she was always
shown a slight coldness in the city. Folks whispered
together as she passed; the old people
shook their heads, the children laughed as they
pointed to the belfry. Even the good Pope had
no longer quite the same confidence in his friend,
and whenever he permitted himself to take a little
nap on her back on Sundays on returning from
his vineyard, this thought always came to him:
“What if I should awake 'way up there on the
platform!” The mule discerned this and suffered,
without saying a word; only, when any one near
her mentioned the name of Tistet Védène, her
long ears quivered, and with a little laugh she
would sharpen the iron of her shoes on the paving.</p>

<p>Seven years passed thus; then at the end of
those seven years Tistet Védène returned from
the Court of Naples. His time there was not at
an end; but he had learned that the Pope’s chief
mustard-bearer had died suddenly at Avignon,
and, since the post suited him well, he had come
in great haste in order to apply for it.</p>

<p>When that intriguer of a Védène entered into
the great hall of the palace, the Holy Father had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
difficulty in recognizing him, so tall had he grown,
and stout of body. It must be said, too, that the
worthy Pope had grown old and could no longer
see well without spectacles.</p>

<p>Tistet was not frightened.</p>

<p>“What, Holy Father, you do not remember me
any more? It is I, Tistet Védène!”</p>

<p>“Védène?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, you know very well—the one who
used to carry the wine <em>à la Française</em> to your
mule.”</p>

<p>“Oh—yes—yes—I remember. A good little
fellow, that Tistet Védène! And now, what is it
that he wants of us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a very little thing, Holy Father. I came
to ask you—by the way, do you still have your
mule? And is she well? Ah, so much the better!
I came to ask of you the post of the chief mustard-bearer,
who has just died.”</p>

<p>“First mustard-bearer, you! Why, you are too
young. How old are you, then?”</p>

<p>“Twenty years two months, illustrious Pontiff,
just five years older than your mule. Ah! that
excellent creature! If you only knew how I loved
that mule! How I languished for her in Italy!
Are you not going to let me see her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my child, you shall see her,” said the
good Pope, deeply moved. “And since you loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
her so much, that excellent animal, I do not wish
you to live apart from her. From this day, I
attach you to my person as chief mustard-bearer.
My cardinals will raise an outcry, but so much the
worse! I am used to it. Come to meet us tomorrow
as we return from vespers, we will deliver
to you the insignia of your office in the presence of
our chapter, and then—I will take you to see the
mule, and you shall come to the vineyard with us
two—ha! ha! Go along, now!”</p>

<p>If Tistet Védène was content upon leaving the
grand hall, I need not tell you with what impatience
he awaited the ceremony of the next day.
Meanwhile, they had some one in the palace who
was still more happy and more impatient than he:
it was the mule. From the time of Védène’s
return, until vespers on the following day, the
terrible creature did not cease cramming herself
with oats and kicking at the wall with her hind
feet. She too was preparing herself for the ceremony.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the morrow, when vespers had
been said, Tistet Védène made his entrance into
the courtyard of the papal palace. All the high
clergy were there—the cardinals in red robes, the
advocate of the devil in black velvet, the convent
abbés with their little mitres, the church-wardens
of the Saint-Agrico, the violet hoods of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
members of the household, the lesser clergy
also, the papal soldiers in full uniform, the
three brotherhoods of penitents, the hermits
from Mount Ventoux with their ferocious eyes
and the little clerk who walks behind them
carrying the bell, the Flagellant Brothers, naked
to the waist, the blond sacristans in robes
like judges—all, all, down to those who pass the
holy water, and he who lights and he who extinguishes
the candles—not one was missing. Ah!
That was a beautiful installation, with bells, fireworks,
sunlight, music, and, as always, those mad
tambourine players who led the dance down by
the Avignon Bridge.</p>

<p>When Védène appeared in the midst of the assemblage,
his imposing deportment and fine
appearance called forth a murmur of approbation.
He was a magnificent Provençal of the blond type,
with long hair curled at the ends and a small unruly
beard which resembled the shavings of fine
metal from the graving tool of his father, the
carver of gold. The report was current that the
fingers of Queen Joanna had now and then toyed
with that blond beard; and the Sire de Védène
had in truth the haughty air and the absent look
of those whom queens have loved. That day, to
do honor to his nation, he had replaced his Neapolitan
garb by a jacket bordered with color-of-rose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
in the Provençal fashion, and in his hood
trembled a great plume of the Camargue ibis.</p>

<p>As soon as he had entered, the first mustard-bearer
bowed with a gallant air, and directed his
steps toward the grand dais, where the Pope
awaited him in order to deliver to him the insignia
of his office: the yellow wooden spoon and the
saffron-colored coat. The mule was at the foot
of the staircase, all caparisoned and ready to
depart for the vineyard. When he passed her,
Tistet Védène had a pleasant smile and paused to
give her two or three friendly pats upon the back,
looking out of the corner of his eye to see if the
Pope noticed him. The situation was admirable.
The mule let fly:</p>

<p>“There! You are trapped, bandit! For seven
years I have saved that for you!”</p>

<p>And she let loose a kick so terrible, so terrible
that at Pampérigouste itself one could see the
smoke: a cloud of blond smoke in which fluttered
an ibis plume—all that was left of the ill-fated
Tistet Védène.</p>

<p>Mules’ kicks are not ordinarily so appalling;
but then this was a papal mule; and besides,
think of it! she had saved it up for seven years.
There is no finer example of an ecclesiastical
grudge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2b">PROSPER MÉRIMÉE, IMPERSONAL ANALYST</h2>
</div>


<p>Among French masters of the short-story,
Prosper Mérimée easily holds rank in the
first group. Both personality and genius are his,
and both well repay scrutiny.</p>

<p>Stendhal has given us a picture of Mérimée as a
“young man in a gray frock-coat, very ugly, and
with a turned-up nose.... This young man
had something insolent and extremely unpleasant
about him. His eyes, small and without expression,
had always the same look, and this look was
ill-natured.... Such was my first impression
of the best of my present friends.”</p>

<p>An examination of at least eight several portraits
of Mérimée indicates that Stendhal’s picture
is far from flattering, yet no one ever charged
Mérimée with being pretty.</p>

<p>Our author was born in Paris, September 28,
1803. His father, Jean François, was a cultivated
artist and a writer of some ability. While professor
at the École des Beaux-Arts, the elder
Mérimée married Anne Moreau, a pupil. She
was a successful painter of children, and often
kept them in quiet pose by telling them stories.
Her grandmother, Madame de Beaumont, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
long before endeared herself to children of all time
by writing “Beauty and the Beast.” The Mérimée
home naturally attracted the artists and
celebrities of many lands, so that Prosper was
reared in an air of refinement and inspiration.</p>

<p>Versatile from childhood, Mérimée took to
drawing like a fine-arts pupil, passed through
college, was successful in his law examinations,
and at an early age took up literature as a
vocation.</p>

<p>His career was seconded by many journeys
abroad, where he served his country particularly
as man of letters, art critic, and archæologist.
At home he received important public recognition,
notably membership in the French Academy
and appointment as a Senator of France. This
latter honor evidenced the warm personal esteem
of the Empress Eugénie, whom he had known as
a girl in Spain, and at whose court—in the reign
of Napoleon III—he was received as an intimate
rather than as a courtier. Notwithstanding his
reticence, everywhere his friends were many and
distinguished, for scarcely any other Frenchman
ever labored so brilliantly in capacities collateral
with literature and yet attained to such a pinnacle
of many-sided authorship. He died at Cannes,
September 23, 1870, lacking five days of rounding
out his sixty-seventh year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>Those who would know somewhat of Mérimée’s
spirit must read his <em>Letters to an Unknown Woman</em>—letters
covering thirty-nine years of his life.
For the first nine years the correspondents never
met, but when at length they did, it was to love;
and though during the succeeding thirty years
the affection cooled, there never failed a solid
attachment, and the last letter to his <em>Inconnue</em>
was penned but two hours before his death.
True, in these epistles the author is always the
literary artist expressing the moods of a man and
a lover, and so is never to be taken quite
unawares, yet all his traits are disclosed with
sufficient openness to show the real man.</p>

<p>And this real man, who was he? An alert
student of history, who yet was so fascinated by
its anecdotal phases that he cared not at all for
the large philosophy of events in sequence; a
linguist who early delved into Greek and Latin,
knew English well enough to memorize long passages
from the poets, spoke Castilian Spanish as
well as several dialects, and translated Russian—Pushkin,
Gogol, and Turgenieff—with rare
ability; an epicure in travel, keen for the curious
and the novel; a connoisseur in art and archæology
of sufficient distinction to warrant his
appointment as the national “Inspector of Monuments;”
a prejudiced scorner of priests and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
religion, yet bitterly distrustful of his own inner
light; an orderly man, systematic even in his
indulgences; a pagan in refined sensualism, which
he always checked before its claims impinged too
largely upon other domains; an aloof spirit,
ironical and cold, yet capable of the warm friendship
that made Stendhal happy for two days by
receiving one of Mérimée’s letters, constant
enough to pour out his best at the feet of his
Unknown for more than half a lifetime, and so
gentle as to crave with the tender heart of a father
the love of little children.</p>

<p>The sum of all this is Enigma. We are not sure
which is the real man; but this we know: his was
a tender, susceptible heart beating under an outer
garment of ironical coldness. To love deeply was
to endure pain, to follow impulse was to court
trouble, to cherish enthusiasms was to delude the
mind—so he schooled himself to appear impassive
and blasé. How much of this frosty withdrawal
was genuine and how much a protective mask,
no man can say.</p>

<p>Mérimée’s literary methods reflected his
singularly composite personality, yet the author
is not apparent in his work. He delighted to tell
his tales in the impersonal, matter-of-fact manner
of the casual traveller who had picked up a good
story and passed it on just as it was told to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“They contain,” writes Professor Van Steenderen,
“no lengthy descriptions. There are no
reflections, dissertations, or explanations in them.
They bring out in relief only the permanent
features of a given situation, features interesting
and intelligible to men of other ages and climes.
They are lucid and well constructed. Their plots
turn about a simple action with unique effect.
Their style is alert, urbane, discreet, and rich,
seeking its effect only through concrete and simple
means. They deal but very slightly with lyrical
emotion, they deal with passions and the will.”</p>

<p>Mérimée’s literary career began at the age of
twenty-two, when he published a collection of
eight of his short plays purporting to be translated
from the Spanish. His portrait, disguised
as a Spanish actress, serves as a frontispiece. He
perpetuated a similar hoax two years later when
he issued a volume of pseudo-Illyrian poems,
“translated into French.” These brilliant jokes
gulled the literary world as completely as did
Chatterton.</p>

<p>His historical fiction, pure history, dramas,
criticisms, essays, and works on art and
archæology, we must pass. His shorter fiction
claims attention now.</p>

<p>“Colomba”—a novelette in length, but a
long short-story in structure—is the story of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
Corsican vendetta, followed to the end by the
heroine (from whom the story takes its title) with
a wild ferocity tempered with a queer sort of piety.
Mérimée’s fatalism underlies the whole—circumstances
control the will, chance decides the
brigand or the benefactor, virtue and crime are
mere accidents.</p>

<p>When Mérimée published “Colomba,” in 1840,
he was at the height of his genius, and notwithstanding
the enervating philosophy in which the
romance is steeped, it remains one of the most
powerfully dramatic stories ever written—both
terrible and sweet.</p>

<p>Of his twenty-some briefer fictions—mostly
tales in form—eight at least are brilliant examples
of the story-teller’s art, and all show marks of
distinction. Six were published in one fruitful
year—1829: “Mateo Falcone,” “The Vision of
Charles XI,” “The Taking of the Redoubt,”
“Tamango,” “Federigo,” and “The Pearl of
Toledo.”</p>

<p>“Tamango” is a fine specimen of Mérimée’s
artistic irony, yet underneath are compassion,
and hatred of injustice. As does most of the
author’s work, this tale reveals his tendency to
tragedy, even his love for picturing the gruesome.
There is in all literature no more terrible picture of
the slave-trade and its revolting consequent evils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“Mateo Falcone” is a technically perfect short-story.
Mateo is a well-to-do sheep-raiser living
in the plateau country of Corsica, whose thickets
were often the resort of fugitives from justice.
One day Mateo and his wife set out early to visit
one of their flocks, leaving the little son, Fortunato,
at home. Several hours later a bandit,
limping painfully from a wound received from
the pursuing soldiery, claims sanctuary as a
Corsican and protection because of his friendship
for Mateo. Fortunato hesitates, but at sight of a
five-franc piece hides the man under a haystack.
Soon the soldiers come, but threats cannot make
the boy betray the bandit. A silver watch, however,
proves an effective bribe. Just as the
wounded bandit is dragged from the haystack,
Mateo returns and learns the truth. When the
soldiers have gone, bearing their contemptuous
prisoner on a litter, the father takes out little
Fortunato and, after giving him time to say a
final prayer, shoots him as the first traitor in the
family.</p>

<p>This, says Walter Pater, is “perhaps the
cruellest story in the world.” But it is not all
cruelty. So skilfully, so sincerely, does the narrator
make us feel the whole spirit of the scene,
the people, the crisis, that we are prepared to
witness the awful penalty for violating the Corsican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
code of sanctuary. But oh, the hopelessness
of that mother, as she stoically, yet with breaking
heart, sees the inevitable tragedy closing in upon
those whom she loves!</p>

<p>“The Venus of Ille” the author thought to be
his best story. It is notable—as all of Mérimeé’s
stories are—for its perfect local color, as well as
for its subtle air of the weird. It is one of the
classic “ghost” stories of the world—a tale of
supreme distinction. It is also, structurally, the
author’s most perfect short-story.</p>

<p>M. de Peyrehorade unearths a bronze statue of
a woman, which is thereafter known as The
Venus of Ille. From the beginning this statue
is feared by the peasantry, for when it was dug up
it fell upon and broke the leg of a workman.
Peyrehorade’s son Alphonse is betrothed to a
wealthy girl. On their wedding day, while playing
tennis, he removes from his hand the bride’s
diamond ring and places it on the finger of the
statue. On arriving at the home of the bride-to-be,
he discovers the absence of the ring, but
replaces it with another, without mentioning the
incident. After the wedding he returns with his
bride to his father’s home and tries to remove the
ring from the hand of the Venus; but her fingers
are now bent and he cannot. That night the
terrified bride hears the Venus enter their bed-chamber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
and lie down beside her. Thinking it to
be her husband, she makes no comment. But
presently the husband does come in and lies down
upon the bed. Whereupon the bronze Venus
crushes him to death in her embrace and then
moves away as she came.</p>

<p>In “Arsene Guillot” (1844), Mérimée’s masterpiece
of pathos, he has given freer rein to his
sympathies, and the result is a tenderly moving
tale illustrating the virtue of tolerance.</p>

<p>In early manhood Mérimée spent long stretches
in Spain, there absorbing rich material for his
stories. “Carmen”—the story on which Bizet
founded his opera—is the greatest of these. It
was published in 1845, and in length is almost a
novelette.</p>

<p>Don José Lizzarrabengoa, Navarrese, and
corporal in a cavalry regiment, meets at Seville
the gypsy, Carmen. While taking her to prison
for a murderous assault on another woman, he is
induced to connive at her escape, and is punished
by being reduced to the ranks. Through jealous
infatuation for her, he kills his lieutenant, and
joins a band of smugglers of which Carmen is the
leading spirit. In a duel with Garcia, her <em>rom</em>,
or husband, Don José kills Garcia, and becomes
in his turn the <em>rom</em> of the fascinating gypsy.
Jealous of every man who sees her, Don José<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
offers to forget everything if she will go with him
to America. She refuses—for the sake of another
lover, as he believes—and he threatens to kill her
if she persists. She answers that it is so written,
and that she has long known it, but that “free
Carmen has been, and free she will always be.”
Don José does kill her, buries her in the woods,
and rides to Cordova, where he delivers himself
to the authorities.</p>

<p>But it is now time to look particularly at one
of Mérimée’s earlier tales—written when he was
but twenty-six—“The Taking of the Redoubt.”</p>

<p>Technically it is a tale, with the picture-phrases
of the sketch. It is a marvellous brief story rather
than a marvellous short-story, which, as I have
before remarked, must exhibit more plot, more
complication, with its consequent dénouement,
than is found in either the tale or the sketch.
As a work of art, it ranks with the author’s most
vivid stories. In the memorable phrase of Walter
Pater, “Seldom or never has the mere pen of a
writer taken us so close to the cannon’s mouth.”</p>

<p>Before reading the story itself in translation,
some explanatory words may be helpful. It is
interesting to note the device which Mérimée uses
to add reality to his narrative—he tells us that
the story, the characters, the place, the fight, are
real. Even those who stand in the wings, flitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
across the stage but once as if to say, “I am flesh
and blood, and not a mere stuffed figure like the
doll whose only pains were in her sawdust”—even
they have names and personalities dimly
veiled under the initial and the dash.</p>

<p>Mérimée’s friend, the “military man” from
whom he got the story, is Henri Marie Beyle—who
called himself de Stendhal. Stendhal was
a somewhat prolific author, but it was <em>La Chartreuse
de Parme</em> (1839) that brought him fame.
As a romantic tragi-comedy, dealing with Italy
in the Napoleonic era, it is worth a reading, but
particularly because the so-called <em>Épisode de
Waterloo</em> (in chapters 3 and 4) reveals the
measurable debt which Mérimée owed to his
friend.</p>

<p>Stendhal was indeed “a military man.” He
first smelled powder in the Marengo campaign
(1800), and served long in Napoleon’s armies.
But he was actually present in 1812 at the assault
upon Cheverino, in the Moscow campaign, and
doubtless he afterward poured its dramatic story
red-hot into the soul of Mérimée.</p>

<p>In another detail also Mérimée departs from
fact—Stendhal died in Paris in 1842 of apoplexy,
and not of “a fever in Greece;” but surely that
is a mild variation for a fictionist. “The 4th
September” is also true to the actual, since the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
battle of Borodino took place on the 7th, and the
arrival at Moscow on the 14th, 1812. “General
B——” is General Berthier, chief-of-staff for
Napoleon in the Moscow campaign. “Madame
de B——” has been identified as Madame de
Boigne, the intimate of Madame Récamier, and
a resident of the rue de Provence. In her salon
Mérimée read aloud many of his stories before
publication. Other critics suggest that “Madame
B——” is Madame (la comtesse) de Beaulaincourt,
and support this contention by referring
to a collection of eleven letters addressed to this
noble dame by Mérimée, and later published.
Finally, “General C——” is that famous
Napoleonic soldier, Jean Dominique Compans,
who actually commanded the 57th and the 61st
regiments at Cheverino.</p>

<p>But a volume might be written on the art of
this master story-teller, on the life-experiences
from which he drew his plots, and on the glowing
praises which his work has called forth for three-quarters
of a century. Doubtless, however, his
own work will now serve better than further pages
of introduction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE TAKING OF THE REDOUBT</h2>
</div>

<p class="big1 center">(<em>L’ENLÈVEMENT DE LA REDOUTE</em>)</p>

<p class="big2 center">By Prosper Mérimée</p>

<p class="p2b center"><em>Done into English by the Editor</em></p>


<p>A friend of mine, a military man, who
died of a fever some years ago in Greece,
described for me one day the first engagement in
which he had taken part. His recital so struck
me that I wrote it from memory as soon as I had
the leisure. Here it is:</p>

<p>I joined the regiment the 4th September at
evening. I found the colonel in the camp. He
received me rather bruskly; but after having
read the letter of recommendation from General
B—— he changed his manner and spoke to me
a few courteous words.</p>

<p>I was presented by him to my captain, who had
returned at that instant from a reconnoissance.
This captain, with whom I had had scarcely time
to become acquainted, was a tall, dark man, of
hard, repellent visage. He had been a private,
and had won his epaulets and his cross upon the
field of battle. His voice, which was hoarse and
feeble, contrasted singularly with his almost
gigantic stature. They told me he owed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
strange voice to a ball which had pierced him
through and through at the battle of Jena.</p>

<p>On learning that I had just left the school at
Fontainebleau, he made a grimace and said:</p>

<p>“My lieutenant died yesterday.”</p>

<p>I understood that he meant to say, “It is you
who must take his place, and you are not capable
of it.” A sharp retort leaped to my lips, but I
contained myself.</p>

<p>The moon was rising behind the redoubt of
Cheverino, which was situated two cannon-shots
from our bivouac. She was large and red, as
usual at her rising. But, on this evening, she
seemed to be of extraordinary grandeur. For one
instant the redoubt stood out sharply in black
against the glittering disk of the moon. It resembled
the cone of a volcano at the moment of
eruption.</p>

<p>An old soldier, beside whom I found myself,
remarked upon the color of the moon.</p>

<p>“She is very red,” said he; “it’s a sign that it
will cost us dear to take that famous redoubt!”</p>

<p>I have always been superstitious, and that
augury, above all at that moment, affected me.
I sought my couch, but I was not able to sleep.
I arose, and for some time I walked, watching
the immense line of fires which covered the
heights above the village of Cheverino.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>When I believed that the fresh and sharp air
of the night had sufficiently cooled my blood, I
returned to the fire; I enveloped myself carefully
in my mantle, and I closed my eyes, hoping not to
open them before day. But slumber refused to
come. Insensibly my thoughts took on a doleful
hue. I told myself that I had not one friend
among the hundred thousand men who covered
that plain. If I were wounded, I should be in a
hospital, treated without regard by ignorant
surgeons. All that I had heard said of surgical
operations recurred to my memory. My heart
thumped with violence, and mechanically I
arranged like a kind of cuirass the handkerchief
and the portfolio I had in my bosom. Weariness
overwhelmed me, I nodded every instant, and
every instant some sinister idea reproduced itself
with renewed force and startled me out of my
sleep.</p>

<p>However, fatigue carried the day, and when
they beat the reveille, I was sound asleep. We
were drawn up in battle array, the roll was called,
then we stacked arms, and everything indicated
that we should pass a tranquil day.</p>

<p>About three o’clock, an aide-de-camp arrived,
bringing an order. We were ordered to take up
arms again; our skirmishers spread themselves
over the plain; we followed slowly, and in about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
twenty minutes we saw all the Russian advance-posts
fall back and reënter the redoubt.</p>

<p>One battery of artillery was established on our
right, another at our left, but both well in advance
of us. They opened a very lively fire upon
the enemy, who replied vigorously, and soon the
redoubt of Cheverino disappeared under the
dense clouds of smoke.</p>

<p>Our regiment was almost covered from the
Russian fire by a rise of ground. Their bullets,
rarely aimed at us (for they preferred to fire at
our gunners), passed over our heads, or at worst
showered us with earth and little stones.</p>

<p>As soon as we had received the order to march
forward, my captain looked at me with an attention
which obliged me to pass my hand two or
three times over my youthful mustache with an
air as unconcerned as was possible to me. In
truth, I was not frightened, and the sole fear that
I experienced was lest he should imagine that I
was afraid. The harmless bullets contributed
still more to maintain me in my heroic calm.
My self-esteem told me that I was going into real
danger, since at last I was under battery fire. I
was enchanted to be so at my ease, and I dreamed
with pleasure of telling in the salon of Madame
B——, rue de Provence, how the redoubt of
Cheverino was taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>The colonel passed before our company; he
said to me: “Well, you are going to have hot
work for your début.”</p>

<p>I smiled with a perfectly martial air as I
brushed the sleeve of my coat, on which a bullet
that had struck the earth thirty yards away had
cast a little dust.</p>

<p>It appeared that the Russians had observed
the ill success of their cannon-balls; for they
replaced them with shells, which could more easily
reach us in the hollow where we were posted.
One rather big explosion knocked off my shako,
and killed a man near me.</p>

<p>“My compliments,” said the captain, as I
picked up my shako. “You are safe now for the
day.” I knew that military superstition which
believes that the axiom, <em>non his in idem</em><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, finds its
application on a field of battle as in a court of
justice. I jauntily replaced my shako.</p>

<p>“That is making a man salute, without ceremony,”
I said, as gaily as I could. That bad joke,
in the circumstances, seemed excellent.</p>

<p>“I felicitate you,” responded the captain.
“You will get nothing worse, and to-night you
will command a company; for well I know that
the oven is being heated for me. Every time that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>I have been wounded the officer nearest me<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> has
been touched by a spent ball, and,” he added,
in a lower tone, and almost as though ashamed,
“their names always commenced with a P.”</p>

<p>I pretended to feel brave; many persons would
have done as I did; many persons too would have
been as deeply impressed by those prophetic
words. Conscript as I was, I realized that I
could not confide my sentiments to any one, and
that I must always appear coolly intrepid.</p>

<p>After about a half-hour, the Russian fire
diminished perceptibly; whereupon we sallied
from our cover to march upon the redoubt.</p>

<p>Our regiment was composed of three battalions.
The second was ordered to turn the redoubt on
the side of the entrance; the two others were to
make the assault. I was in the third battalion.</p>

<p>In coming out from behind the species of ridge
which had protected us, we were received by
several discharges of musketry which did but
little damage in our ranks. The whistling of the
balls surprised me: often I turned my head, and
so drew upon myself divers pleasantries on the
part of my comrades who were more familiar
with that sound.</p>

<p>“Take it all in all,” I said to myself, “a battle
is not such a terrible matter.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>
<p>We advanced in double-time, preceded by
skirmishers: all at once the Russians gave three
hurrahs—three distinct hurrahs—then remained
silent, and without firing.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this silence,” said my captain.
“It bodes no good for us.”</p>

<p>I thought that our men were a trifle too noisy,
and I could not help mentally comparing their
tumultuous clamor with the imposing silence of
the enemy.</p>

<p>We quickly attained the foot of the redoubt;
the palisades had been shattered, and the earth
ploughed up by our balls. The soldiers rushed
upon these new ruins with cries of “<em>Vive l’Empereur!</em>”
with more vigor than one would have
expected to hear from men who had already
cheered so much.</p>

<p>I raised my eyes, and never shall I forget the
spectacle that I saw. Most of the smoke had
lifted and remained suspended like a canopy
about twenty feet above the redoubt. Through
a bluish vapor, behind their half-ruined parapet,
one could descry the Russian grenadiers, firearms
raised, immobile as statues. I think I can see
each soldier yet, the left eye fastened upon us,
the right hidden behind his levelled musket. In
an embrasure, a few feet from us, a man holding
a lighted fuse stood beside a cannon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>I shuddered, and I believed that my last hour
had come.</p>

<p>“The dance is about to commence,” cried out
my captain. “Good-night!”</p>

<p>These were the last words that I heard him
utter.</p>

<p>A roll of drums resounded within the redoubt.
I saw every musket lowered. I closed my eyes,
and I heard an appalling crash, followed by cries
and groans. I opened my eyes, surprised to find
myself still living. The redoubt was anew
enveloped in smoke. I was surrounded with the
bleeding and the dead. My captain was stretched
out at my feet: his head had been crushed by a
bullet, and I was covered with his brains and his
blood. Of all my company none remained but
six men and me.</p>

<p>To this carnage succeeded a moment of stupor.
The colonel, putting his hat on the point of his
sword, was the first to scale the parapet, crying:
“<em>Vive l’Empereur!</em>” He was followed instantly
by all the survivors. I do not remember clearly
just what followed. We entered within the
redoubt, how I do not know. We fought body to
body amid a smoke so dense that we could not
see one another. I believe that I smote, for I
found my sabre was all bloody. At last I heard
the cry, “Victory!” and, the smoke diminishing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
I saw blood and dead bodies completely covering
the earthworks of the redoubt. The cannons
especially were buried beneath piles of corpses.
About two hundred men, in the French uniform,
were grouped without order, some loading their
muskets, others wiping their bayonets. Eleven
hundred Russian prisoners were with them.</p>

<p>The colonel was lying all covered with blood
upon a broken caisson near the entrance. Several
soldiers bestirred themselves around him: I
approached.</p>

<p>“Where is the senior captain?” he inquired of
a sergeant.</p>

<p>The sergeant shrugged his shoulders in a
manner most expressive.</p>

<p>“And the senior lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“This gentleman here, who arrived yesterday,”
said the sergeant, in a perfectly calm tone.</p>

<p>The colonel smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>“Come, sir,” he said to me, “you are now in
chief command; promptly fortify the entrance
of the redoubt with these wagons, for the enemy
is in force; but General C—— will see that you
are sustained.”</p>

<p>“Colonel,” I said to him, “you are severely
wounded?”</p>

<p>“Pish, my dear fellow, but the redoubt is
taken!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak p2b">PIERRE LOTI, COLORIST</h2>
</div>


<p>Pierre Loti is a cosmopolitan. Halévy
was a Parisian, Maupassant was a Norman
acclimated to the habitudes of Paris, and Daudet
carried with him throughout all his experiences
in the French capital the dreamy soul of Provence;
but Loti is essentially a modern. Man of the
world, not alone by temperament but by reason
of wide journeyings afield and minglings with men
and women of all lands, he typifies the spirit of
to-day in French literature as few other writers
have done. He is a poetic idealist, or, perhaps
more precisely, an idealistic realist, writing at a
time when realism was most potent in France.</p>

<p>The externals of Loti’s life are soon recounted.
Louis Marie Julien Viaud was born in Rochefort,
January 14, 1850, the same year that gave
Maupassant to the world of art. The name
“Loti” is an invented derivative of that seductive
tropical flower, the lotus, and therefore was not
his by inheritance, but the affectionate gift of his
South Sea enchantress, Queen Pomaré, of Tahiti,
when the young naval officer visited the island in
1872.</p>

<p>The frail, prim, sensitive child described with
so much self-insight in his autobiographic <em>Le<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
Roman d’un enfant</em> not only inbreathed his love
for the sea in salt-scented Rochefort, but dreamed
incessantly of the far-off lands he was destined to
visit. These visions were stimulated, if not inspired,
by early reading, and by the letters of an
older brother who had long been in the navy.
So at seventeen we naturally find him a midshipman,
and in due course ensign and lieutenant,
serving with distinguished bravery—as his Cross
of the Legion of Honor testifies—in the Tonquin
campaign, when France must needs re-subdue
her protectorates in Asia.</p>

<p>M. Loti’s later life has been spent mostly
ashore, serving in the Admiralty, yet the cravings
of boyhood have been indulged so often as might
be, and foreign lands, by preference oriental,
visited year by year.</p>

<p>In 1891 M. Loti was elected to that all-coveted
distinction, membership in the Academy, where
he occupies the chair once honored by Racine and
Scribe.</p>

<p>Loti’s portraits show us a Gallic face, a short,
pointed beard, tired, melancholy eyes, and a
general air of earnestness not quite substantiated
by his pleasure-loving life. In stature somewhat
below medium height, in form slender, he early
gave himself to those bodily exercises which once
caused a professional acrobat to wonder why our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
author had not begun his gymnastics early enough
to turn his steel-like muscles to spectacular
account!</p>

<p>So much for the more patent facts of his life.
But how to make just presentment of his mental
and spiritual traits I do not know, for the task
gave pause even to Loti himself.</p>

<p>He never learned to write; his gift was native.
With reading he had at first small commerce,
preferring to turn page after page in human
hearts, and to read deep in the tome of his own
nature of bewildering variety. A composite is
Loti—almost a chameleon, not only entering into
the multi-life of lands and peoples where he
chances to sojourn, but taking on their colors,
and even their garbs and customs. But of this
somewhat more in due order.</p>

<p>Here is a character inextricable from his work,
much of which is autobiographical, since in most
of his twenty-seven volumes the author himself
appears either thinly disguised under some
sobriquet, or frankly named in <em>propria persona</em>.
So while we are at no time at a loss for material
wherewith to make up an estimate, this material
is both embarrassingly rich and—contradictory.
Still, no one can mistake the main-travelled roads
in this life, they are bold and distinct.</p>

<p>Loti wrote little verse, but he was a poet. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
moved in the upper layers of feeling—feeling for
nature, for animals, for man, for woman—and
always he was the idealistic, though not the ideal
lover. His sympathies were positively unquenchable,
and each new passion found him fresh,
tender, elemental—and as sincere as the temporary
lover can be. In elemental, primitive folk
he found his personal loves and his fictive characters;
in the death of a little bird or in the lives
of two cats he centred a genuine interest; in the
moods of the uncompassed sea he felt a vast
concern.</p>

<p>Inevitably, the religious life of such a temperament
would not be constant: Protestantism the
Huguenot youth found to be cold; his test of the
ceremonial worship of Romanism satisfied him
only for a little; at last his faith was doubt.</p>

<p>Loti’s direct disregard of the interests of conventional
life, in favor of nature-children, constitutes
one of his greatest literary charms. Freshness,
simplicity of viewpoint, naïve boyishness of
spirit—these excel all the accomplishments of the
stylist’s art in an author whose style is as subtle as
gossamer, as varicolored as the evening sea he
painted with supernal beauty.</p>

<p>In all his work Loti greatly prefers description
above dialogue. “Long and quiet stretches of
writing” abound, but their minuteness leaves us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
unwearied, and though he repeats and re-repeats
we are conjured into accepting his pictures as
ever new.</p>

<p>In style, in delicacy of nature-feeling, where in
all literature will you find aught to excel this
passage from <em>Mon frère Yves</em>?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Even the nights were luminous. When all
was slumbering in heavy immobility, in dead
silence, the stars shone out above, more dazzling
than in any other region of earth, and the sea
also was illumined from beneath. There was a
sort of immense gleam diffused over the waters;
the lightest motion, such as the slow gliding of
the boat, or a shark darting after it, brought out
upon the warm eddies flashes like the color of a
fire-fly. Then, over the great phosphorescent
mirror of the deep, there were millions of wild
flames—they were like little lamps lighting themselves
everywhere, burning mysteriously for a
second or two, then dying out. These nights
were swooning with heat, full of phosphorescence;
and in all this dim immensity light was brooding,
and all these seas held latent life, in a rudimentary
state, as did formerly the gloomy waters of
the primeval world.”</p>
</div>

<p>As in the foregoing, so in the following, see how
this necromancer of words accomplishes the impossible—“the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
planks of the ship” are the only
solid, palpable substances in this atmospheric
delicacy from <em>Pecheur d’Islande</em> (An Iceland
Fisherman):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Outside it was daylight, perpetual daylight.
But it was a pale, pale light, resembling nothing
else; it threw dim reflections over everything,
as of a dead sun, and beyond these, all was an
immense void without color; everything outside
the planks of the ship seeming diaphanous, impalpable,
unreal.</p>

<p>“The eye could scarcely distinguish the sea.
First it took on the aspect of a sort of trembling
mirror, with no image reflected in it; as it spread
further it seemed to become a vaporous plain,
and beyond this there was nothing—no outline
nor horizon.</p>

<p>“The damp freshness of the air was more intense,
more penetrating, than actual cold; and
in breathing it one was conscious of a taste of
brine. All was calm, and it was no longer raining;
above, formless, colorless clouds seemed to
hold that latent, unexplained light; one could
see plainly, while conscious all the time that it
was night, and all these pallors were of no shade
that can be named.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>This is not description—it is miracle; it is,
in the fine phrase of M. Doumic, “evocation;”
it is music, color, subtlety, spirit, all thrown upon
the soul’s retina and sensed in some magic manner
that refuses to be classified. No one but a pantheist,
sensitive to all the moods of nature—and
especially those of that abysmal enigma, the sea—could
have evoked such visions, such realities,
where other eyes see—water.</p>

<p>In form our author’s books are varied, following
rarely any preconceived plan, we may well
suppose—only this, that the literary wanderer
with his new book every year takes us by the hand
and shows us the intimacies of his own life-experiences,
discloses the little-known beauties
and sadnesses he has uncovered everywhere, and
turns into simple yet exquisitely wrought fictions
the poignant truths that have entered his own
heart. Not one novel, technically considered,
did he write, but sketches strung like pearls upon
a thread: vivid impressions of home and foreign
life, longer or shorter stories of simple folk whose
days dawned to labor and were twilit with weariness,
colorful pictures of men and women living
under eastern skies—and beneath and about all,
the many-spirited sea.</p>

<p>It would require a volume to deal adequately
with Loti’s many books; but one point invites<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
mention: each new annual volume for a score of
years discloses his life in some new land, or in the
Brittany of his affection.</p>

<p>His first volume, <em>Aziyadé</em> (1879), is the record
of his love for a beautiful Circassian slave while he
sojourned in Turkey—the record, too, of how she
died of grief after his departure. <em>Rarahu</em>—later
issued as <em>Le Mariage de Loti</em>—recounts his loves
in Tahiti, and much of charm and beauty besides.
<em>Le Roman d’un Spahi</em> transports us to the Sahara
and Senegal, <em>Fleurs d’ennui</em> to Montenegro,
<em>Madame Chrysanthème</em> to Japan, <em>Au Maroc</em> to
Fez and Tangier, and <em>Le désert</em>, and <em>Jérusalem</em>,
and <em>La Galilée</em>, to Palestine.</p>

<p>I name these volumes not to attempt a catalogue
of Loti’s works, but to show how world-broad
were the scenes he chose for his impressionistic
brush. Naturally, all of the foregoing works
are more or less oriental in tone, and the moral
code revealed is not that of “the most approved
families.” But three masterpieces there are
which breathe a more wholesome air—though
heavy, each one, with the tragedy of life.</p>

<p><em>Mon frère Yves</em> is the plotless account of “a
splendid Breton sailor and the author, his officer.”
They enjoy “a sort of companionship which finds
its analogy—in a way—in the friendly relations
formerly [held] between young master and slave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
in our Southern States.” No picture of the robust
rollicking sailor—superstitious, drink-loving, adventurous,
warm-hearted—could be more real,
none more pathetic, and none more rich in fragments
of narrative.</p>

<p>In <em>Le livre de la pitié et de la mort</em> eleven stories
are brought together to harmonize with the saddening
title—“The Book of Pity and of Death!”
One of these, “The Sorrow of an Old Convict” is
an impressionistic tale of an old highwayman who
is being shipped away to exile. His only solace
is a caged bird with a broken wing, and when one
day the door is opened the little bird falls into
the sea. That is all—but to read it is to feel
with Yves the heart-break of that bereft old man.</p>

<p>“The Wall Opposite” is a study of human
tendencies. A mother, a daughter, and an aged
aunt are compelled by reverses to let out those
rooms of their apartments that faced out upon
the street, but their own little back suite had a
cozy and intimate air. Its windows overlooked
a court whose walls were covered with honeysuckle
and roses. One day they were told that in
the court a high wall was to be built which would
steal away the air and hide the sun. They had no
money wherewith to buy off the project, so in one
short month a grayish-white wall—almost like a
twilight sky of November—shut them in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>Long they had looked for an inheritance which
would some day come to them. Then they would
buy the house and tear down that wall—and always
the old aunt used to pray that she might live to
see that day. But the bequest was long in coming.</p>

<p>One day a young man came, introduced by
friends, and for a while he sat at the table of these
“three ladies without fortune.” He was handsome
and high-spirited, and the young girl loved
him, but she was poor, and for lack of sunlight
the color had begun to fade from her cheeks. So
he went away and never returned.</p>

<p>Twenty years passed—the aunt had died, the
mother had grown gray, and the daughter was
now past forty. Then at last the inheritance
came. They sent away their lodgers, but somehow
the two women remained in the little back
<em>salon</em>. They had come to love it. At last the wall
which for twenty years they had endured would
be torn down. At twilight of the second day the
wall was razed, but the mother and daughter
sitting at their table were bewildered at seeing so
clearly. The wall was gone—they had the light,
the roses and vines! For twenty years they had
hoped for this happiness, yet now—they were
uneasy, something seemed to have gone wrong.
A sort of melancholy had come over them.</p>

<p>The mother, looking into her daughter’s eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
saw tears. “It can be built up again,” she says.
“It seems to me they can try, can they not, to
make it the same again?”</p>

<p>“I, too, thought of that,” replied the daughter.
“But no, don’t you see? <em>It would never be the same!</em>”</p>

<p>And this was the secret: more than the power
of custom in her Life was the fact that the wall had
been the background of a picture—the face of a
young man which she had watched through one
short spring-time.</p>

<p>This is one of Loti’s few technically perfect short-stories.
His sketchy, rambling, loosely-plotted
“novels” and travel-reflections differ greatly
in manner from the compact story of plot, but his
writings do abound in easily separable fragments,
or episodes—as to which a word must now be set
down, before we take up the plot and the final
scenes of Loti’s greatest work, <em>Pecheur d’Islande</em>.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the spontaneity of the novel,
many authors are more concerned for the vividness
of their narration than for mere technical
form. Hence they feel free to introduce incidents
which are related more or less loosely to the plot,
and serve rather as auxiliaries than as vital parts
of the action. The purpose may be to develop a
tone, suggest an atmosphere, illustrate certain
traits of character, or, it may be, to amplify an
organic part of the plot. This narrative by-path,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
this illuminating side-light, we technically call an
episode. It was most in vogue among the early
English novelists; Defoe, Richardson, Smollett,
Fielding, and Goldsmith followed it so habitually
that all of their novels are episodic in form. But
even in the more highly organized French
romances of plot—<em>Les Miserables</em> and <em>Les
Mystères de Paris</em>, for example—we find frequent
episodes. This tendency is naturally more
marked in the tale and in the prolonged sketch
than in the closely plotted novel. Indeed, it is
only in the very <em>long</em> plot-novel that the episode
can find room, since the prosperity of the short
plot-novel lies largely in the close and rapid
sequence of its incidents.</p>

<p>Even though “The Marriage to the Sea”—as
I have ventured to entitle this climacteric close
of <em>An Iceland Fisherman</em>—is an essential plot
incident, and therefore an organic part of the
whole, still, considered solely for its own sake, it
is easily detachable. So we may regard it as
<em>almost</em> a typical specimen of the episode; that is
to say, we need only have some slight prior knowledge
of the setting and the relation of the characters
to invest it with the completeness and
unity of a perfect short-story. True, the crisis
has occurred—unknown to the fisherman’s wife—before
this episode begins, but that could scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
have been arranged more artistically, with regard
to suspense, had Loti purposed to use the episode
as a separate story. Here we have the carefully
laid groundwork of tone, environment, and characters.
Here, too, are the breathless expectancy,
the increasing suspense (which constitutes the
complication), two false anticipations of a happy
dénouement, and then the actual dénouement,
with the artistic close.</p>

<p><em>An Iceland Fisherman</em> is Pierre Loti’s most
perfect work, and it is gratifying to note that it is
also his most popular, as witness some three
hundred and fifty French editions, and an unknown
number of translations. In form, it is
less a typical novel than a brilliant impressionistic
tale. A major episode is the story of Sylvestre,
which, woven closely in its earlier part with the
life of Yann and his sweetheart Gaud, at length
diverges, when the fisherboy passes into the navy,
fights a good fight in Cochin-China, and dies
amid pathetic circumstances in far-off Singapore.</p>

<p>The plot is very simple. It is laid in Paimpol,
in Brittany, whose dwellers rely solely upon the
Iceland fisheries. Every year these hardy Vikings
of Northern France fare away to the Iceland
waters and return only after a long season there.
The chief characters are Yann Gaos, a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
splendid young fisherman with handsome brown
curls, and Gaud, the daughter of “the great man”
of the town. The two are in love, and Yann ventures
some hesitating advances; but her father’s
wealth deters the fisherman from making a full
avowal. However, when Gaud’s father dies she
is found to be penniless; still Yann unaccountably
holds back, much to Gaud’s secret sorrow.
Homeless, she goes to live with Granny Moan,
the grandmother of the ill-fated young Sylvestre,
who had been betrothed to Yann’s sister. At
length, in the little hut where Gaud lives as the
bereft old woman’s foster-grandchild, she and
Yann are married.</p>

<p>Only a few days after their wedding, the bridegroom
sails away on the fine new <em>Léopoldine</em> for
the Iceland fisheries. When autumn comes the
boat does not return with the others. All that is
heard of her is from the crew of the <em>Marie-Jeanne</em>,
who report a mystic meeting with the <em>Léopoldine</em>
in a dense fog, when each vessel loomed up to the
other out of the mist and then passed spectre-like
away, with time for only a few quick cries of
recognition from fellow-townsmen. The final
scene opens with all the town awaiting the return
of the fishers. One vessel has already come in,
and then opens this closing episode.</p>

<p>The Iceland ships were returning—two the
second day, four the next, and twelve during
the week following. And throughout the country
joy returned with them—there was happiness for
the wives and mothers; happiness too in the
taverns where the pretty Paimpol girls served
drink to the fishermen.</p>

<p>The <em>Léopoldine</em> was in the group of belated
ones; there were still ten missing. They could
not be long now, and Gaud, in the thought that
Yann would be there within a week—an extreme
of delay which she allowed for so as not to be
disappointed—was in a delicious intoxication of
expectancy, keeping the home well in order—very
clean and very neat—to receive him.</p>

<p>Everything being in readiness, there was nothing
more for her to do; besides, in her impatience
her head could hold only the one thought.</p>

<p>Three more of the tardy ships now arrived, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
then five. Only two were wanting from the
muster.</p>

<p>“Come!” they said to her laughingly, “this
year it is either the <em>Léopoldine</em> or the <em>Marie-Jeanne</em>
that will have to stay behind 'to sweep
up.’”</p>

<p>And Gaud laughed—even she—more animated
and more beautiful in her joy of anticipation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the days passed by.</p>

<p>She continued to dress every day, to put on a
gay air, to go to the harbor a-gossiping with the
others. She said that it was all quite natural, this
delay. Didn’t they see the same thing every
year? Oh, as to their coming back at all—with
such good sailors, and two such good boats!</p>

<p>Afterwards, when she was back home at night,
the old shiver of anxiety, of anguish, would come
over her.</p>

<p>Could it be really possible that she began to
fear—already? Was there any cause for fear?
And she trembled, for having so soon been afraid.</p>

<p>The tenth of September! How the days flew
by!</p>

<p>One morning when there was a cold mist over
the earth, a true autumn morning, the rising sun
found her early seated under the porch of the
chapel of the shipwrecked mariners, at the place
where the widows go to pray—seated, she was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
with eyes fixed and temples tense as though held
in a band of iron.</p>

<p>Two days ago these melancholy mists of dawn
had begun, and on this particular morning Gaud
had awakened with a more poignant inquietude,
caused by this impression of winter. Why was it
so this day, this hour, this moment, more than the
preceding? She knew well enough that boats
were often two weeks late—even a month.</p>

<p>But there was something different about this
particular morning, without doubt, for she had
come to-day for the first time to sit under the
chapel porch and reread the names of the young
men who had died.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">In Memory of<br>

</p>

<p>Like a great shudder, a gust of wind was heard
rising from the sea, and at the same time something
fell like rain upon the roof: it was the dead
leaves. A whole host of them were blown in at
the porch; the old wind-tossed trees of the graveyard
were losing their foliage, stripped by this
gale from the sea. Winter was coming.</p>

<p>She read mechanically, and through the arch
of the doorway her eyes sought to pierce the
distance over the sea: that morning it was very
vague, under the gray mist, and a suspended
cloud-drapery trailed over the horizon like a great
mourning-veil.</p>

<p>Another gust of wind, and other dead leaves
came dancing in. A stronger squall, as if the
west wind that had strewn these dead over the
sea wished to torment even the inscriptions which
recalled their names to the living.</p>

<p>Gaud looked with involuntary persistence at
an empty space upon the wall which seemed to
wait with terrible expectancy; she was pursued
by the thought of a fresh slab that might perhaps
soon be placed there, with another name which
even in spirit she did not dare repeat in such a
place.</p>

<p>She felt cold, but remained seated on the granite
bench, her head thrown back against the stone
wall.</p>

<p>Iceland appeared to her, with its little cemetery—Iceland
far, far away, lighted from below the
sea-line by the midnight sun ... and suddenly—still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span> 
in the same empty space on the wall which
seemed to be waiting—she saw with horrifying
clearness the vision of that new slab she had
imagined: a fresh tablet, a death’s-head and
cross-bones, and in the centre, within a flame,
a name—the adored name of <em>Yann Gaos</em>! Then
she drew herself up straight and stiff, with a
hoarse, wild cry in her throat like a mad creature.</p>

<p>Without, the gray dawn-mist still hung over
the earth, and the dead leaves continued to come
dancing into the porch.</p>

<p>Steps on the foot-path!—Was somebody coming?—Then
she arose quickly, with a swift movement
readjusting her coif, and composed her
countenance. The footsteps came nearer, as
though they would enter. At once she assumed
the air of being there by chance. Not for anything
in the world would she as yet seem like the
widow of a shipwrecked mariner.</p>

<p>It was only Fante Floury, the wife of the mate
on the <em>Léopoldine</em>. She understood at once what
Gaud was doing there; it was useless to dissemble
with her. And at first they stood mute, the one
before the other, these two women; all the more
alarmed and angry at being entrapped while in
the same mood of fear, they almost hated each
other.</p>

<p>“All those from Tréguier and from Saint-Brieuc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
have been back for a week,” said Fante at
last, pitilessly, in a voice low and almost irritated.
She carried a taper, meaning to make a votive
offering.</p>

<p>Ah! Yes! a votive offering—Gaud had not
wished to think as yet of that last resort of the
desolate. But she entered the chapel behind
Fante, without saying anything more, and they
knelt side by side, like two sisters.</p>

<p>To the Virgin, Star of the Sea, they said their
passionate prayers with all their hearts. But only
the sound of sobs was heard, and their rapid tears
began to fall upon the floor.</p>

<p>They arose together, more tender, more confident.
Fante aided the tottering Gaud, and,
taking her in her arms, she kissed her.</p>

<p>After wiping away their tears, arranging their
hair, and brushing the saltpetre and dust of the
flagstones from their skirts at the knees, they
went away without saying anything more, by
different paths.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This September’s close was like another
summer, only it was somewhat melancholy. The
weather was really so beautiful this year that had
it not been for the dead leaves that fell in a
mournful shower along the roadways one might
have said that it was the gay month of June.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Husbands, fiancés, sweethearts, had all returned,
and everywhere was the joy of a second spring-time
of love.</p>

<p>At last one day one of the delayed ships from
Iceland was signalled in the offing. Which one?</p>

<p>On the cliff, groups of mute and anxious women
quickly formed. Gaud was there, trembling and
pale, by the side of the father of her Yann.</p>

<p>“I firmly believe,” said the old fisher—“I firmly
believe it’s them! A red sail, a topsail that clews
up—that’s jolly well like them anyhow. What
do you say, Gaud, my girl?</p>

<p>“And yet—it isn’t,” he went on, with sudden
discouragement; “no, we’ve made a mistake
again, the boom isn’t the same, and they have a
flying jib. Well, well, it isn’t them this time,
it’s the <em>Marie-Jeanne</em>. Oh! but very surely, my
girl, they’ll not be long now.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And day followed day, and each night came at
its appointed hour, with inexorable tranquillity.</p>

<p>Gaud continued to dress every day, somewhat
like a mad woman, always in fear of seeming to be
the widow of a shipwrecked sailor, exasperated
when others glanced at her compassionately and
furtively, and looking aside so that she might not
meet those glances that froze her very blood.</p>

<p>Now she had fallen into the habit of going of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
mornings right to the end of the headland on the
high cliffs of Pors-Even, passing behind Yann’s
paternal home so as not to be seen by his mother
or his little sisters. She went all alone to the
extreme point of the Ploubazlanec land, which is
outlined in the shape of a reindeer’s horn against
the gray Channel, and sat there all day long at the
foot of a lonely cross, which rises above the
immense expanse of waters.</p>

<p>There are many of these granite crosses hereabout,
set up on the uttermost cliffs of this land of
mariners, as though to implore mercy,—as though
to appease that restless, mysterious thing that
lures men away and never gives them back, and
by preference keeps the bravest, the noblest.</p>

<p>Around this cross of Pors-Even stretched evergreen
moors, carpeted with short rushes; and at
this great height the sea air was very pure, having
scarcely any of the briny smell of the seaweed,
but perfumed with the delicious ripeness of
September.</p>

<p>Outlined in the far distance could be seen, one
after another, all the indentations of the coast,
the land of Brittany terminating in ragged edges
which stretched far out into the tranquil void of
the waters. Near at hand the reefs riddled the
sea, but out beyond nothing troubled its polished
mirror. There sounded over all a soft, caressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
murmur, light and infinite, arising from the deeps
of its every bay. And the distance seemed so
calm, and the depths so soft! The great blue void,
the tomb of the Gaos family, guarded its
inscrutable mystery while the breezes, faint as
human sighs, wafted here and there the perfume
of the gorse, which had bloomed again in the latest
autumn sun.</p>

<p>At certain hours regularly the sea retreated,
and shallow places grew larger everywhere, as if
the Channel were slowly emptying itself; then,
with the same lazy slowness, the waters rose
again, and continued their eternal going and
coming without any heed of the dead.</p>

<p>And Gaud, seated at the foot of the cross,
remained there, in the midst of these tranquil
scenes, gazing ever before her, until the night fell,
until she could see no more.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>September had passed. Gaud could no longer
take any nourishment, she could no longer sleep.</p>

<p>She remained at home now, and sat crouching
with her hands between her knees, her head
thrown back and leaning against the wall behind.
What was the good of getting up, what was the
good of going to bed? When she was too much
exhausted she threw herself dressed upon her bed.
Otherwise she always remained seated, benumbed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
her teeth chattered with cold, in her
stony quiet; always she had that sense of a band
of iron round her brows; her cheeks felt drawn,
her mouth was dry, with a feverish taste, and at
times a raucous groan rose from her breast, spasmodically
repeated again and again, while she
beat her head against the granite wall.</p>

<p>Or else she called Yann by his name, very
tenderly, in a low voice, as if he were quite close,
and whispered to him words of love.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would think of other things
besides him—of many little, insignificant things;
she would amuse herself, for example, by watching
the shadow of the china Virgin and the holy-water
basin lengthen slowly over the high woodwork of
her bed as the sun went down. And then the
thoughts of anguish returned with more horror,
and her cry broke forth again while she beat the
wall with her head.</p>

<p>And so all the hours of the day passed, one
after the other, and all the hours of the evening,
and all those of the night, and all those of the
morning. When she had reckoned how long it was
since he ought to have been back, a still greater
terror laid hold upon her; she wished to forget all
about the dates and even the names of the days.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Usually there are some indications concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
the wrecks off Iceland: those who return have
seen the tragedy from afar; or else they have
found some wreckage, or a dead body, or have
some sign from which to divine the facts. But no,
of the <em>Léopoldine</em> nothing had been seen, nothing
was known. The men of the <em>Marie-Jeanne</em>, the
last to have seen her on the 2d of August, said
that she was to have gone on fishing farther
towards the north, and beyond that the mystery
was unfathomable.</p>

<p>Waiting, always waiting, without knowing anything.
When would the moment come when she
truly need wait no longer? She did not even know
that; and now she almost wished that it might be
soon.</p>

<p>Oh! if he was dead, let them at least have pity
enough to tell her!</p>

<p>Oh! to see him as he was at this very moment—him,
or even what remained of him! If only the
Virgin, prayed to so often, or some other such
power, would grant her the blessing of showing
him to her, by some sort of second-sight—her
Yann—him—living, struggling to return to her—or
else his body surrendered by the sea, so that
she might at least be sure, that she might
know.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would suddenly have the feeling
that a sail was appearing on the rim of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
horizon: the <em>Léopoldine</em> approaching, hastening
home! Then she would make the first involuntary
movement to rise, and rush to look out at the
ocean, to see whether it were true.</p>

<p>She would fall back. Alas! where was the
<em>Léopoldine</em> now? Where could it be? Out afar,
doubtless, at that awful distance of Iceland,
abandoned, crushed, lost!</p>

<p>And this ended in that never-fading vision,
always the same: a wreck, gaping and empty,
rocked upon the silent sea of gray and rose—rocked
slowly, slowly, without sound—with an
extreme of gentleness quite ironical—in the
midst of the vast calm of the dead waters.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Two o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>It was at night especially that she held herself
attentive to all the steps that approached; at
the least stir, at the slightest unaccustomed
sound, her temples vibrated; from being overstrained
that they might sense things from without,
they had become terribly sensitive.</p>

<p>Two o’clock in the morning. This night as on
others, hands clasped and eyes open in the dark,
she listened to the wind making its well-nigh
eternal moan over the earth.</p>

<p>Suddenly the steps of a man—rapid steps on
the path! At such an hour, who could be passing?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
She drew herself up, stirred to the deeps of her
soul, her heart ceasing to beat.</p>

<p>Some one stopped before the door; some one
mounted the small stone steps.</p>

<p>He! Oh! joy of heaven, he! Some one had
knocked, could it be any other! She was up,
barefooted; she, so feeble for so many days, had
sprung up nimbly as a cat, her arms outstretched
to wind round her well-beloved. Without doubt
the <em>Léopoldine</em> had come in at night, and anchored
opposite Pors-Even Bay; and he—he had rushed
home; she arranged all this in her mind with the
swiftness of lightning. And now she tore her
fingers upon the spikes of the door—in her fury to
draw the bolt it had stuck.</p>

<p>Ah!... And now she slowly moved back,
crushed, her head fallen upon her breast. Her
sweet mad dream was over. It was no one but
Fantec, their neighbor. She could just comprehend
that it was not he, her Yann, that no part of
his being had passed through the air; she felt
herself plunged again into her old abyss, to the
uttermost depths of her same awful despair.</p>

<p>He apologized, poor Fantec: his wife, as Gaud
knew, was very ill, and now their baby was suffocating
in its cradle, seized with a malignant sore
throat; so he had come to beg for help, while he
ran to hunt up the doctor at Paimpol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>What did all this matter to her? She had gone
mad in her grief, she had nothing left to offer to
others in distress. Huddled on a bench, she sat
before him with eyes glazed, as one dead, not
answering him, not hearing him, not even looking
at him. What were these things to her that the
man was saying!</p>

<p>He understood it all; he divined why the door
had been opened to him so quickly, and he had
pity for the pain he had brought about.</p>

<p>He stammered out an apology: Just so; he
ought never to have disturbed her—her especially.</p>

<p>“I!” replied Gaud quickly, “and why not I,
Fantec?”</p>

<p>Life had returned to her suddenly, for still she
did not want to appear despairing before the eyes
of others—for that she was quite unwilling. And
besides, in her turn she pitied him; she dressed to
accompany him and found strength to go see his
little child.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When she returned to throw herself upon her
bed, at four o’clock, sleep laid hold upon her in a
moment, for she was utterly fatigued. But that
moment of immense joy had left upon her mind
an impression which, in spite of all, was persistent;
she awoke soon with a shudder, rising a little, as
remembering something.... She had some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
news concerning her Yann.... In the midst
of this confusion of ideas which came back to her,
rapidly she searched and searched her mind for
what it could have been.</p>

<p>Ah! nothing, alas, nothing but Fantec!</p>

<p>And a second time she fell back to the depths
of the old abyss. No, in reality, nothing was
changed in her morbid, hopeless waiting.</p>

<p>Still, to have felt Yann there so close was as if
some emanation from him had come floating back
to her; it was what they call in Breton land a
token; and she listened still more attentively for
footsteps outside, divining that some one would
perhaps come who would talk to her of him.</p>

<p>And indeed, when the day broke, Yann’s father
entered. He took off his cap, pushed back his
beautiful white locks, which were in curls like
those of his son, and sat down beside Gaud’s
bed.</p>

<p>His heart too was in agony, for his Yann, his
splendid Yann, was his first-born, his favorite,
his glory. But he did not despair, not really,
he did not despair yet. He began to reassure
Gaud in a very gentle way: to begin with, the
latest ones to return from Iceland had all spoken
of the extremely dense fogs which might easily
have delayed the vessel; and then too an idea
had come to him: a stop-over at the Faroes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
which are islands situated on their route, at a
great distance; and when they sent letters from
there, they took a long time to come; the same
thing had happened to himself forty years ago,
and his poor dead mother had already had a mass
said for his soul.... And such a good boat,
was the <em>Léopoldine</em>, and all those aboard were such
able mariners.</p>

<p>Old Granny Moan walked around them, shaking
her head; the distress of her foster grand-daughter
had almost given her back her own
strength and reason; she tidied up the place,
glancing from time to time at the little faded
portrait of her Sylvestre, which hung upon the
granite wall with its anchor emblems and mourning-wreath
of black beadwork; no, since following
the sea had robbed her of her grandson, she
believed no longer in the safe return of sailors;
she now prayed to the Virgin only from fear, with
the outside of her poor old lips, cherishing in the
bottom of her heart a grudge against her.</p>

<p>But Gaud listened eagerly to these consoling
reasonings, her large sunken eyes looking with
deep tenderness upon this old sire who so much
resembled her well-beloved; just to have him
near her was like a hostage against death, and
she felt more reassured, nearer to her Yann. Her
tears fell silently and more gently, and she repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
again her passionate prayers to the Virgin,
Star of the Sea.</p>

<p>A stop-over, 'way out at those islands, to repair
damages, was a likely event. She rose, brushed
her hair, and made some sort of toilet, as if he
might possibly return. Doubtless all was not lost
if his own father did not yet despair. And for a
few days she again took up her waiting.</p>

<p>It was full autumn now, late autumn—with the
nightfalls gloomy, and all things growing dark
early in the old cottage, and all the Breton land
looking sombre, too. The very days seemed but
twilight; immeasurable clouds, slowly passing,
would suddenly bring darkness at broad noon.
The wind moaned constantly—it was like the
sound of a great cathedral organ at a distance,
but playing profane airs, or despairing dirges;
at other times it would come close to the door, and
lift up a howl like wild beasts.</p>

<p>She had grown pale, pale, and became ever
more dejected, as if old age had already touched
her with its featherless wing. Very often she
would finger the belongings of her Yann, his fine
wedding clothes, folding and unfolding them like
some maniac—especially one of his blue woolen
jerseys, which still retained the form of his body;
when thrown gently on the table, it disclosed
from long usage the outlines of his shoulders and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
chest; but at last she placed it by itself on a shelf
of their wardrobe, never to remove it, so that it
might long preserve that impress.</p>

<p>Every evening cold mists rose from the ground;
then through her little window she would gaze
over the melancholy land, where little patches
of white smoke began to rise here and there from
other chimneys: the rest of the men had returned,
migratory birds driven home by the cold. And
before many of these fires the evenings would be
sweet; for the spring-time of love had begun with
winter, in all this country of “Icelanders”.</p>

<p>Still clinging to the thought of those islands
where he might perhaps have put in, buoyed up
by a kind of hope, she had again begun to expect
him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He never returned.</p>

<p>One night in August, far away in the waters of
gloomy Iceland, amid a great fury of storm, he
had consummated his Marriage to the Sea—to
the Sea which had been his nurse: it was she who
had cradled him, who had made him a big and
strong youth, and afterward, in his superb manhood,
had taken him back again for herself alone.</p>

<p>A profound mystery had surrounded the unhallowed
nuptials. All the while, dark veils
trembled overhead, moving and twisting curtains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
were spread so as to conceal the ceremony; and
the bride gave voice, ever seeking with louder
and more awful roars to stifle his cries.... He,
thinking of Gaud, his mortal wife, had battled
with giant strength against this spouse of the
tomb—until the moment when he at last surrendered,
with a great cry, deep as the roar of a
dying bull, his mouth already filled with water,
his arms open, extended, and stiffened forever.</p>

<p>And at his wedding were all those whom he
had at one time invited. All except Sylvestre,
who himself had gone to sleep in the enchanted
gardens, far, far at the other side of the earth.</p>
